summary: Mexico is one of the main centres of origin of agriculture and
  domestication of a diversity of plant species that are fundamental for food
  security. Given the importance of conserving traditional crops, research in
  the country has mainly focused on crop diversity at the genetic level of these
  few crops. However, thanks to the country's geographic location, the
  biocultural heterogeneity of the landscape, and openness to international
  markets, today, Mexico grows more than 200 food crop species. This study used
  statistical analysis of Mexican agricultural census data to evaluate changes
  in Crop Species Diversity (CSD) from 1980 to 2016 for five agroecological
  regions of Mexico. CSD temporal trends are described through simple linear
  models, segmented regressions, and a Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling
  (NMDS) technique. Overall, we found that while diversity has been increasing
  in 4 out of 5 regions, regions are becoming more similar. This homogenization
  of the Mexican agricultural sector could therefore have major social, economic
  and environmental implications.
