	abstract = {Reducing exposure to air pollution is an important goal formany local and national governments. Disparities in air pollution exposure by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class are well documented; reducing these disparities is another important policy target. Meeting both goals requires tools to evaluate how emission reduction options affect average exposures and exposure disparities. Here, we consider the role of emission location in implementing control strategies, and investigate the effect of two practical, space-based approaches—low-emission zones and truck rerouting—on diesel particle levels in Southern California.We employ Eulerian gridmodeling to explore the impact that emission location has on four outcomes important to policymakers: total pollution exposure, exposure efficiency (i.e. exposure impact per unit emission), exposure inequality (i.e. deviations fromexposure being equally distributed across the population; unequal exposure among individuals), and exposure injustice (i.e. associations between exposure and demographic attributes such as race or ethnicity; unequal exposure among groups). Our results highlight potential trade-offs (e.g. an increase in equality but reduction in justice for interventions in some locations) as well as opportunities for ‘win-win’ solutions (locations for which emission reductions would reduce all four target outcomes). We find that a simple, straightforward approach—reducing emissions in neighborhoods with a high proportion ofminority residents—may ormay not yield the strongest benefits to environmental justice; the reason is that the straightforward approach fails to account formeteorology and where pollution travels after being emitted. In short, we demonstrate an approach that can be used to identify areas in which emissions reductions would have high efficiency and would also result in disproportionately large reductions to average exposure, exposure inequality, and exposure injustice. The approach presented here could be used to design and prioritize local or national emission reduction efforts. 1.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@incollection{haughton_inequality_nodate,
	title = {Inequality {Measures}},
	abstract = {Inequality is a broader concept than poverty in that it is defined over the entire 
population, and does not only focus on the poor. 
The simplest measurement of inequality sorts the population from poorest to 
richest and shows the percentage of expenditure (or income) attributable to each 
fifth (quintile) or tenth (decile) of the population. The poorest quintile typically 
accounts for 6–10 percent of all expenditure, the top quintile for 35–50 percent. 
A popular measure of inequality is the Gini coefficient, which ranges from 0 (perfect 
equality) to 1 (perfect inequality), but is typically in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 for 
per capita expenditures. The Gini coefficient is derived from the Lorenz curve, which 
sorts the population from poorest to richest, and shows the cumulative proportion 
of the population on the horizontal axis and the cumulative proportion of expenditure 
(or income) on the vertical axis. While the Gini coefficient has many desirable 
properties—mean independence, population size independence, symmetry, and 
Pigou-Dalton Transfer sensitivity—it cannot easily be decomposed to show the 
sources of inequality. 
The best known entropy measures are Theil’s T and Theil’s L, both of which allow 
one to decompose inequality into the part that is due to inequality within areas (for 
example, urban and rural) and the part that is due to differences between areas (for 
example, the rural-urban income gap), as well as the sources of changes in inequality 
over time. Typically, at least three-quarters of inequality in a country is due to 
within-group inequality, and the remaining quarter to between-group differences. 
Atkinson’s class of inequality measures is quite general, and is sometimes used. 
The decile dispersion ratio, defined as the expenditure (or income) of the richest decile divided by that of the poorest decile, is popular but a very crude measure 
of inequality. 
A Pen’s Parade graph can be useful in showing how incomes, and income distribution, 
change over time. Microsimulation exercises are increasingly used to identify 
the sources of changes in income distribution, and to identify changes resulting from 
changes in prices, in endowments, in occupational choice, and in demographics.},

	abstract = {This book is about the creative and messy process of making environmental-management decisions. The approach we describe is called Structured Decision Making, a distinctly pragmatic label given to ways for helping individuals and groups think through tough multidimensional choices characterized by uncertain science, diverse stakeholders, and difficult trade-offs. This is the everyday reality of environmental management, yet many important decisions currently are made on an ad hoc basis which lacks a solid value-based foundation, ignores key information, and results in selection of an inferior alternative. Making progress – in a way that is rigorous, inclusive, defensible, and transparent – requires combining analytical methods drawn from the decision sciences and applied ecology with deliberative insights from cognitive psychology, facilitation, and negotiation. We review key methods and discuss case-study examples based in our experiences in communities, boardrooms, and stakeholder meetings. Our goal is to lay out a compelling guide that will change how you think about making environmental decisions. We gratefully acknowledge partial funding support from the Decision, Risk and Management Science program of the US National Science Foundation (Award No. 0725025). We also acknowledge intellectual support from many colleagues and clients over the years who – through a mix of interest, curiosity, and frustration with conventional methods – have seen fit to work with us on a wide range of environmental-management problems, including Joe Arvai, Trent Berry, Cheryl Brooks, Mark Burgman, Bob Clemen, Jean Cochrane, Alec Dale, Nate Dieckmann, Daryl Fields, Baruch Fischhoff, Bill Green, Nicole Gregory, Paul Higgins, Dan Kahneman, Jack Knetsch, Howard Kunreuther, Sarah Lichtenstein, Lynn Maguire, Steven Morey, Ellen Peters, Mike Runge, Terre Satterfield, Basil Stumborg, William Trousdale, Nancy Turner, Terry Walshe, Carl Walters, Tim Wilson, and Kristin Worsley.

	abstract = {We live in the age of Big Data, awash in a sea of ever-expanding information—a constant deluge of facts, statistics, models, and projections. The human mind is quickly desensitized by information presented in the form of numbers, and yet many important social and environmental phenomena, ranging from genocide to global climate change, require quantitative description. 
 
The essays and interviews in Numbers and Nerves explore the quandary of our cognitive responses to quantitative information, while also offering compelling strategies for overcoming insensitivity to the meaning of such information. With contributions by journalists, literary critics, psychologists, naturalists, activists, and others, this book represents a unique convergence of psychological research, discourse analysis, and visual and narrative communication. 
 
At a time of unprecedented access to information, our society is frequently stymied in its efforts to react to the world’s massive problems. Many of these problems are systemic, deeply rooted in seemingly intransigent cultural patterns and lifestyles. In order to sense the significance of these issues and begin to confront them, we must first understand the psychological tendencies that enable and restrict our processing of numerical information. 
 
Numbers and Nerves explores a wide range of psychological phenomena and communication strategies—fast and slow thinking, psychic numbing, pseudoinefficacy, the prominence effect, the asymmetry of trust, contextualized anecdotes, multifaceted mosaics of prose, and experimental digital compositions, among others—and places these in real-world contexts. In the past two decades, cognitive science has increasingly come to understand that we, as a species, think best when we allow numbers and nerves, abstract information and experiential discourse, to work together. This book provides a roadmap to guide that collaboration. It will be invaluable to scholars, educators, professional communicators, and anyone who struggles to grasp the meaning behind the numbers.},

While the inventory serves as Canada's community right-to-know program, the growing number of listed substances and reporting facilities makes it exceedingly difficult for the public to discern which substances are of greatest concern in their respective communities. A chemical's impact is best characterized when its environmental release data are combined with its toxicity and environmental fate properties. Presently, the NPRI does not provide a synthesis of this critical information and there is a need to provide more context with NPRI data to increase its usability. To help deliver this context, a relative risk ranking was compiled for a subset of NPRI substances using a modified Chemical Hazard and Evaluation Management Strategies (CHEMS-1) model. The model combines toxicity, chemical fate properties, and NPRI release data to yield a risk score for each substance. The resulting risk scores are ranked accordingly to provide a priority ranking of the substances. In addition to contextualizing the NPRI release data with hazard information, the ranking can also help set priorities for future risk assessment and evaluation by the Canadian government and scientific community. Limitations included the reliance on modelled data and default values to fill data gaps and uncertain reliability in reported NPRI data. In spite of its limitations, the CHEMS-1 model is a useful tool for prioritizing NPRI substances.},

Changes must be made to this complex process for the federal government to maintain progress toward its goal of ending long-term DWAs. Funding alone will not resolve the issue. A coalition of organizations has come together to monitor progress on resolving First Nations DWAs in Ontario, including the David Suzuki Foundation, Amnesty International, the Council of Canadians and Human Rights Watch. As of November 2016, Ontario has 81 DWAs in 44 First Nations, with 68 of those classified as long-term. 3 The province claims the highest number of DWAs in the country. The David Suzuki Foundation, in collaboration with the other organizations, assessed progress toward ending long-term DWAs in nine First Nations in Ontario. Data were compiled from interviews, meetings, conferences, reports and media releases, to assess the progress and challenges First Nations face in attaining clean and safe drinking water.

	abstract = {Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM 25 ) has been associated with a greater risk of non-accidental, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in Canada. Research based on Canadian cohorts suggests that exposure to PM 25  varies by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Studies of NO 2 , another pollutant, indicate that persons of lower socioeconomic status and some visible minority groups have greater exposure in urban centres. Data and methods: National residential PM 25  was estimated from a {\textasciitilde}1 km 2  spatial layer for respondents to the 2006 Census long-form questionnaire. Weighted PM 25  estimates from personal-level estimates were determined for white, Aboriginal, visible minority and immigrant populations, as well as for socioeconomic groups (household income, educational attainment) and stratified by urban core, urban fringe and rural residence. Descriptive statistics were provided for selected comparisons. Results: In Canada, PM 2 5  exposure was 1.61 ug/m 3  higher for visible minority (versus white) populations, and 1.55 ug/m 3  higher for immigrants (versus nonimmigrants). When the relatively high percentages of these groups in large cities were taken into account, exposure differences in urban cores were much smaller. Exposure among urban immigrants did not decrease substantially with time since immigration ( {\textless}  0.5 ug/m 3  between any two years). In urban cores, residents of low-income households had marginally higher exposure (0.56 ug/m 3 ) than did people who were not in low-income households.

I measured differences in exposure to air toxics through the calculation of a net difference score, which is a statistical measure used in income inequality analysis to measure inequality over the whole range of exposures. The scores ranged from 11.52 to 83.60. In every metropolitan area, non-Hispanic Blacks are more likely than non-Hispanic Whites to be living in tracts with higher total modeled air toxics concentrations. To assess potential reasons for such a wide variation in exposure differences, I performed a multiple regression analysis with the net difference score as the dependent variable. Independent variables initially included were as follows: the dissimilarity index (to measure segregation), Black poverty/White poverty (to control for Black/White economic differences), population density and percentage of persons traveling to work who drive to work (alone and in car pools), and percentage of workforce employed in manufacturing (factors affecting air quality). After an initial analysis I eliminated from the model the measures of density and the persons driving to work because they were statistically insignificant, they did not add to the predictive power of the model, and their deletion did not affect the other variables. The final model had an R(2) of 0.56. Increased segregation is associated with increased disparity in potential exposure to air pollution.},

	abstract = {We describe spatial patterns in environmental injustice and inequality for residential outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in the contiguous United States. Our approach employs Census demographic data and a recently published high-resolution dataset of outdoor NO2 concentrations. Nationally, population-weighted mean NO2 concentrations are 4.6 ppb (38\%, p,0.01) higher for nonwhites than for whites. The environmental health implications of that concentration disparity are compelling. For example, we estimate that reducing nonwhites’ NO2 concentrations to levels experienced by whites would reduce Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) mortality by ,7,000 deaths per year, which is equivalent to 16 million people increasing their physical activity level from inactive (0 hours/week of physical activity) to sufficiently active (.2.5 hours/week of physical activity). Inequality for NO2 concentration is greater than inequality for income (Atkinson Index: 0.11 versus 0.08). Low-income nonwhite young children and elderly people are disproportionately exposed to residential outdoor NO2. Our findings establish a national context for previous work that has documented air pollution environmental injustice and inequality within individual US metropolitan areas and regions. Results given here can aid policy-makers in identifying locations with high environmental injustice and inequality. For example, states with both high injustice and high inequality (top quintile) for outdoor residential NO2 include New York, Michigan, and Wisconsin.},

	abstract = {Food self-sufficiency gained increased attention in a number of countries in the wake of the 2007–08 international food crisis, as countries sought to buffer themselves from volatility on world food markets. Food self-sufficiency is often presented in policy circles as the direct opposite of international trade in food, and is widely critiqued by economists as a misguided approach to food security that places political priorities ahead of economic efficiency. This paper takes a closer look at the concept of food self-sufficiency and makes the case that policy choice on this issue is far from a straightforward binary choice between the extremes of relying solely on homegrown food and a fully open trade policy for foodstuffs. It shows that in practice, food self-sufficiency is defined and measured in a number of different ways, and argues that a broader understanding of the concept opens up space for considering food self-sufficiency policy in relative terms, rather than as an either/or policy choice. Conceptualizing food self-sufficiency along a continuum may help to move the debate in a more productive direction, allowing for greater con-sideration of instances when the pursuit of policies to increase domestic food production may make sense both politically and economically.},

These high-resolution, near-real-time MODIS data are hypothesized to enhance the representation of land?atmosphere interactions and to potentially improve the WRF model forecast skill for temperature, surface moisture, surface fluxes, and soil temperature. To test this hypothesis, the impact of using MODIS-based land surface data on surface energy and water budgets was assessed within the ?Noah? land surface model with two different canopy-resistance schemes. An ensemble of six model experiments was conducted using the WRF model for a typical summertime episode over the U.S. southern Great Plains that occurred during the International H2O Project (IHOP\_2002) field experiment. The six model experiments were statistically analyzed and showed some degree of improvement in surface latent heat flux and sensible heat flux, as well as surface temperature and moisture, after land use, leaf area index, and green vegetation fraction data were replaced by remotely sensed data. There was also an improvement in the WRF-simulated temperature and boundary layer moisture with MODIS data in comparison with the default U.S. Geological Survey land-use and leaf area index inputs. Overall, analysis suggests that recalibration and improvements to both the input data and the land model help to improve estimation of surface and soil parameters and boundary layer moisture and led to improvement in simulating convection in WRF runs. Incorporating updated land conditions provided the most notable improvements, and the mesoscale model performance could be further enhanced when improved land surface schemes become available.},

Examples of such parameters include leaf area index, roughness length, surface resistance to evapotranspiration, canopy greenness fraction, vegetation density, root distribution, and the fraction of photosynthetically-­‐active radiation absorbed. The MODIS Land Cover Type Product provides a suite of land cover types that support global change science by mapping global land cover using spectral and temporal information derived from MODIS. The objective of this document is to provide information related to the Collection 5 MODIS Land Cover Type Product (MCD12Q1). It is not designed to be a scientific document. Rather, it provides three main types of information: 1. An overview of the MCD12Q1 algorithm and product, along with references to published literature where more details can be found.},

El modelo Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) emplea datos de cobertura de la tierra global Global Land Cover Characteristics (GLCC) creados a partir de imá- genes del satélite NOAA-AVHRR tomadas entre 1992 y 1993. Sin embargo, de 1990 a 2010 la población del país ha crecido en un 29\%, lo cual representa un incremento importante en la extensión de las zonas urbanas, particularmente en la parte central de la República, donde en lugares como el Estado de México o Tlaxcala la población ha crecido en un 34\% y 33\% respectivamente. Debido a lo anterior, con base en el mapa de uso de suelo del 2009 del Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía (INEGI), en este trabajo se actualiza la cobertura urbana en los datos de cobertura de la tierra usados por el modelo WRF para la malla con resolución de 30”. A partir de dos simulaciones se hace un análisis de sensibilidad del pronóstico de temperatura para la ciudad de México y su zona conurbada, así como para las ciudades de Puebla y Tlaxca- la. Se analizaron ocho sitios en donde el uso de suelo cambió de cobertura vegetal a cobertura urbana y se encontró que la temperatura se incrementó entre 0.5 y 5.0 ºC. El promedio de las diferencias máximas en temperatura a lo largo del ciclo diurno es de 2.61 ºC y el promedio de las diferencias en temperatura a lo largo del periodo es de 0.66 ºC. Las diferencias máximas se registran entre las 10:00 y 15:00 horas (hora local). La temperatura máxima promedio obtenida empleando los nuevos datos de cobertura urbana es de 26.96 ºC, mientras que empleando los datos de cobertura urbana GLCC-1993 es de 25.63 ºC. El incremento promedio de la temperatura máxima diaria es de 1.33 ºC y para la temperatura mínima diaria de 0.12 ºC. La hora en la que se alcanza la temperatura máxima ocurre entre las 13:00 y 15:00 horas, mientras que la temperatura mínima se alcanza entre las 4:00 y 6:00 horas. El rango promedio diario usando nuevos datos urbanos es de 16.0 ºC, mientras que usando datos de GLCC-1993 es de 14.9 ºC.

La validación se realiza con 3 estaciones de Bogotá, para las variables precipitación acumulada, temperatura máxima y temperatura mínima. En primer lugar se compara las corridas realizadas por el modelo con la topografía y usos del suelo con datos USGS y la topografía del IGAC con datos de uso del suelo MODIS y USGS. Se observa cierta mejora con el modelo con la topografía corregida, pero no es clara la diferencia al utilizar los datos de uso del suelo MODIS o USGS. Finalmente se validó el modelo operativo iniciado a las 00z para 21 días con 5 días de pronóstico, se encontró que el primer día de pronóstico presenta el error más grande debido a que 6 horas de spin up no son suficientes.

INTRODUCCIÓN Los modelos numéricos de pronóstico del tiempo (NWP) constituyen una herramienta base para entender, explicar y predecir el comportamiento de la atmósfera. El modelo WRF (Skamarock et al, 2005) se caracteriza, no solo por ser uno de los modelos numéricos de predicción del tiempo que mas se utiliza a nivel mundial en las oficinas de pronóstico, sino también por ser muy empleado en el ámbito investigativo Ruiz, 2008)en diversas universidades. (Michalakes et al., 2004). En Colombia, el Instituto de Hidrología, Meteorología y Estudios Ambientales (IDEAM) , la Fuerza Aérea Colombiana (FAC) , el Centro de Investigaciones Oceánicas e Hidrográficas (CIOH) , y otras instituciones no gubernamentales tienen experiencia en la predicción de variables atmosféricas a través de este modelo; mientras que las universidades han reducido su utilización al estudio de casos específicos (Leon et al, 2011). En el caso particular del IDEAM, el modelo WRF se implementó desde el año 2007 con fines de predicción del tiempo para Colombia y la ciudad de Bogotá a una resolución espacial de (20kmx20km) y (7kmx7km) respectivamente (Ruiz, 2008), siendo una herramienta muy importante para los meteorólogos a la hora de tomar decisiones en la emisión del pronóstico oficial.},

The core of this WRF/urban modelling system consists of the following: (1) three methods with different degrees of freedom to parameterize urban surface processes, ranging from a simple bulk parameterization to a sophisticated multi-layer urban canopy model with an indoor–outdoor exchange sub-model that directly interacts with the atmospheric boundary layer, (2) coupling to fine-scale computational fluid dynamic Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes and Large-Eddy simulation models for transport and dispersion (T\{\&\}D) applications, (3) procedures to incorporate high-resolution urban land use, building morphology, and anthropogenic heating data using the National Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (NUDAPT), and (4) an urbanized high-resolution land data assimilation system. This paper provides an overview of this modelling system; addresses the daunting challenges of initializing the coupled WRF/urban model and of specifying the potentially vast number of parameters required to execute the WRF/urban model; explores the model sensitivity to these urban parameters; and evaluates the ability of WRF/urban to capture urban heat islands, complex boundary-layer structures aloft, and urban plume T\{\&\}D for several major metropolitan regions. Recent applications of this modelling system illustrate its promising utility, as a regional climate-modelling tool, to investigate impacts of future urbanization on regional meteorological conditions and on air quality under future climate change scenarios.

	abstract = {More than half of the humanity lives in cities and many cities are growing in size at a phenomenal rate. Urbanisation-driven landuse change influences the local hydrometeorological processes, changes the urban micro-climate and sometimes affects the precipitation significantly. Understanding the feedback of urbanisation driven micro-climatic changes on the rainfall process is a timely challenge. In this study we attempt to investigate the impact of urban growth driven landuse change on the changes in the extreme rainfall in and around cities, by means of sensitivity studies. We conduct three sets of controlled numerical experiments using a mesoscale atmospheric model coupled with a land surface model to investigate the hypothesis that the increasing urbanisation causes a significant increase of extreme rainfall values. First we conduct an ensemble of purely idealised simulations where we show that there is a significant increase of high intensity rainfall with the increase of urban landuse. Then four selected extreme rainfall events of different tropical cities were simulated with first current level of urbanisation and then (ideally) expanded urban areas. Three out of the four cases show a significant increase of local extreme rainfall when the urban area is increased. Finally, we conducted a focused study on the city of Mumbai, India: A landscape dynamics model Dinamica-EGO was used to develop a future urban growth scenario based on past trends. The predicted future landuse changes, with current landuse as control, were used as an input to the atmospheric model. The model was integrated for four historical cases which showed that, had these events occurred with the future landuse, the extreme rainfall outcome would have been significantly more severe. An analysis of extreme rainfall showed that hourly 10-year and 50-year rainfall would increase in frequency to 3-year and 22-year respectively. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Resumen— La predicción meteorológica es un pro-blema clásico de la programación paralela. Muchos de los modelos matemáticos que se utilizan en me-teorología para pronosticar el comportamiento de la atmósfera tienen implementaciones preparadas para ejecutarse en entornos de cálculo paralelo. La información obtenida después de ejecutar un modelo matemático de predicción meteorológica es necesario procesarla para poder visualizar los resul-tados. Sin embargo, no es fácil encontrar herramien-tas que permitan el procesado en paralelo de estas salidas. El presente trabajo plantea la posibilidad de dar un paso más y mejorar el rendimiento, utilizando el paradigma paralelo para procesar las salidas de un modelo de predicción numérica, en concreto, el mo-delo WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting). Palabras clave— Meteorología, predicción numérica, WRF, MM5, netCDF, NCL. I. Introducción La predicción meteorológica consiste en la de-terminación anticipada de los valores de una se-rie de variables meteorológicas, como temperatura, presión, humedad, nubosidad, precipitación, etc., que afectan a una determinada región. En la actuali-dad las predicciones se realizan utilizando modelos de predicción numérica que emplean las ecuaciones de las leyes físicas que describen el comportamiento de la atmósfera. La resolución de las mismas es cierta-mente complicada puesto que se trata de ecuaciones para las que no existe una solución matemática ex-acta que permita determinar los valores futuros de las variables. Por esta razón, es necesario recurrir a las llamadas técnicas de modelización numérica. Formalmente, la utilización de los modelos de predicción del tiempo se basa en resolver de forma numérica, por tanto mediante aproximaciones, un conjunto de ecuaciones diferenciales referidas a la conservación de la masa, la energía y el momento lineal en la atmósfera. Cada modelo hace uso de técnicas peculiares que le confieren ciertas carac-terísticas.

	abstract = {Recently, the cities of Yerba Buena and Tucuman in Tucumán Province, Argentina, have been affected by several storm flood events, causing hundreds of people to be evacuated from their homes. Heavy intensity rainfall, new housing developments covering previously permeable grounds, and old drainage systems are the main causes for this situation. This paper presents a simple approach of urban flood hazard assessment in a region where primary data are scarce. The objectives of this study are to develop a GIS-aided urban flood hazard zoning of the two cities applying multicriteria decision analysis and to evaluate it by means of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The research methodology focused on the analysis of those variables that control the water routing when high peak flows exceed the drainage-system capacity. The model incorporates five parameters: distance to the drainage channels, topography (heights and slopes), ground water table depths, and urban land use. A final hazard map for each category is obtained using an algorithm that combines factors in weighted linear combinations. The urban flood hazard map shows that the southeast part of San Miguel de Tucumán has the highest flood hazard over an extended area as a consequence of the conjunction of lowlands with slopes under 0.6\% and the presence of urban stream channels with poor maintenance plan. In this area, several neighbourhoods have been flooded. The model was evaluated by the error propagation method and global sensitivity analysis to assess the uncertainty and the relative importance of model input factors. Finally, the influence of criterion weights are analyzed ranging from 25\% to 75\% of their original values showing a robust behaviour. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Urban development increases flood risk in cities due to local changes in hydrological and hydrometeorologi- cal conditions that increase flood hazard, as well as to urban concentrations that increase the vulnerability. The relation- ship between the increasing urban runoff and flooding due to increased imperviousness is better perceived than that be- tween the cyclic impact of urban growth and the urban rain- fall via microclimatic changes. The large-scale, global im- pacts due to climate variability and change could compound these risks. We present the case of a typical third world city – Can Tho (the biggest city in Mekong River Delta, Viet- nam) – faced with multiple future challenges, namely: (i) the likely effect of climate change-driven sea level rise, (ii) an expected increase of river runoff due to climate change as es- timated by the Vietnamese government, (iii) increased urban runoff driven by imperviousness, and (iv) enhancement of extreme rainfall due to urban growth-driven, microclimatic change (urban heat islands). A set of model simulations were used to construct future scenarios, combining these influ- ences. Urban growth of the city was projected up to year 2100 based on historical growth patterns, using a land use simulation model (Dinamica EGO). A dynamic limited-area atmospheric model (WRF), coupled with a detailed land sur- face model with vegetation parameterization (Noah LSM), was employed in controlled numerical experiments to esti- mate the anticipated changes in extreme rainfall patterns due to urban heat island effect. Finally, a 1-D/2-D coupled urban- drainage/flooding model (SWMM-Brezo) was used to sim- ulate storm-sewer surcharge and surface inundation to es- tablish the increase in the flood hazard resulting from the changes. The results show that under the combined scenario of significant change in river level (due to climate-driven sea level rise and increase of flow in the Mekong) and “busi- ness as usual” urbanization, the flooding of Can Tho could increase significantly. The worst case may occur if a sea level rise of 100cm and the flow from upstream happen to- gether with high-development scenarios. The relative contri- bution of causes of flooding are significantly different at var- ious locations; therefore, detailed research on adaptation are necessary for future investments to be effective.},

	abstract = {The Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) has undergone significant urban expansion in a closed basin that once supported a large lacustrine system. While urbanization has been mentioned as a factor in observed meteorological trends, a systematic study of the effects of land use-land cover change (LULCC) on seasonal meteorology is lacking. In this study, we utilize theWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF) systemto determine the spatiotemporal changes in near-surface air temperature, precipitation, and boundary layer conditions induced by the modern-day urban landscape relative to presettlement conditions. We capture the MCMA extent through an improved Landsat-based multicategory urban classification and therefore account for intraurban spatial heterogeneity and further conduct additional experiments to examine the sensitivity to anthropogenic heating within WRF. We find that accounting for these factors produced the best simulations of thermal conditions, with RMSE values less than 1.5°C at all measurement stations, and an improved diurnal cycle of air temperature and precipitation.We then assessed the impacts of LULCC in the MCMA, finding that thermal changes were largest during daytime hours, with temperature increasing, on average, by more than 4°C. Furthermore, we utilize these simulations to mechanistically link the built environment-induced increase in air temperature to simulated increases in rainfall during the evening hours. To our knowledge, this study provides the first dynamical and thermodynamical evidence to support the rainfall enhancements documented through observations in the MCMA and link it quantitatively to the warming effects associated with urbanization. These results have important implications for understanding the meteorological conditions leading to widespread urban flooding in the MCMA. © 2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

We engaged tribal members, managers, and researchers to formulate solutions regarding the main topics identified as important to tribal and other land managers: cross-jurisdictional work, fuels reduction strategies, and wildland fire management and research involving traditional knowledge. A key conclusion from the workshops is that successful management of wildland fire and fuels requires collaborative partnerships that share traditional and western fire knowledge through culturally sensitive consultation, coordination, and communication for building trust.

I defined TFK as fire-related knowledge, beliefs, and practices that have been developed and applied on specific landscapes for specific purposes by long time inhabitants. In all, 69 distinct elements of TFK were documented in 35 studies, including accounts from 27 countries on 6 continents. On all 6 continents, 21 elements (30\%) were recorded, and 46 elements (67\%) were recorded on 4 or more continents. The top 12 most commonly reported elements, which were included in {\textgreater} 50 \% of the studies, were fire effects on vegetation; season of the year; fire effects on animals; moisture of live or dead fuels; the onset or end of rainy season, dry season, or timing of rain; burning illegal or regulated by central government; fire intensity, heat output, i.e., hot or cool fire; frequency, return interval, time since fire; fire control; firebreaks, barriers; consequences of not burning; and plant or animal phenology. Traditional fire knowledge was multifaceted: 13 studies included more than 25 elements. Practicing traditional fire management also entails understanding the ways in which multiple elements interact and influence one another. Three classification systems provide insight into TFK systems, including typologies of agro-ecological type, pre- and postindustrial anthropological fire regimes, and viability status. The longevity of traditional fire knowledge and practice faces serious threats at precisely the time when climate change promises disruptions in fire activity that will be problematic for indigenous and nonindigenous societies alike. Central governments tend to adopt the pathological response of command and control during times of fire increase, further constraining traditional fire management. The opposite is needed: to seriously engage traditional practitioners in solving fire problems of global significance.},

	abstract = {Improved wildland fire emission inventory methods are needed to support air quality forecasting and guide the development of air shed management strategies. Air quality forecasting requires dynamic fire emission estimates that are generated in a timely manner to support real-time operations. In the regulatory and planning realm, emission inventories are essential for quantitatively assessing the contribution of wildfire to air pollution. The development of wildland fire emission inventories depends on burned area as a critical input. This study presents a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) - direct broadcast (DB) burned area mapping algorithm designed to support air quality forecasting and emission inventory development. The algorithm combines active fire locations and single satellite scene burn scar detections to provide a rapid yet robust mapping of burned area. Using the U.S. Forest Service Fire Sciences Laboratory (FiSL) MODIS-DB receiving station in Missoula, Montana, the algorithm provided daily measurements of burned area for wildfire events in the western U.S. in 2006 and 2007. We evaluated the algorithm's fire detection rate and burned area mapping using fire perimeter data and burn scar information derived from high resolution satellite imagery. The FiSL MODIS-DB system detected 87\% of all reference fires {\textgreater} 4 km2, and 93\% of all reference fires {\textgreater} 10 km2. The burned area was highly correlated (R2 = 0.93) with a high resolution imagery reference burn scar dataset, but exhibited a large over estimation of burned area (56\%). The reference burn scar dataset was used to calibrate the algorithm response and quantify the uncertainty in the burned area measurement at the fire incident level. An objective, empirical error based approach was employed to quantify the uncertainty of our burned area measurement and provide a metric that is meaningful in context of remotely sensed burned area and emission inventories. The algorithm uncertainty is ± 36\% for fires 50 km2 in size, improving to ± 31\% at a fire size of 100 km2. Fires in this size range account for a substantial portion of burned area in the western U.S. (77\% of burned area is due to fires {\textgreater} 50 km2, and 66\% results from fires {\textgreater} 100 km2). The dominance of these large wildfires in burned area, duration, and emissions makes these events a significant concern of air quality forecasters and regulators. With daily coverage at 1-km2 spatial resolution, and a quantified measurement uncertainty, the burned area mapping algorithm presented in this paper is well suited for the development of wildfire emission inventories. Furthermore, the algorithm's DB implementation enables time sensitive burned area mapping to support operational air quality forecasting.},

	abstract = {? 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.Our chapter presents a review of the use of remote sensing technologies in wildfire management, with a particular emphasis on its applicability to fuel moisture monitoring, fire detection, and burn scar mapping. Remote sensing of fuel moisture was first done with NOAA-AVHRR NDVI images, but NDVI is more related to vegetation greenness rather than water stress. NOAA-AVHRR surface temperature images were also used, alone or in association with NDVI images. Both kinds of images have limited availability due to cloud cover. This is not the case for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images provided by active sensors, but their use in fuel moisture monitoring is still experimental, because of the noisy effects of several factors. The recent availability of polarimetric radar images opens new possibilities of using radar images in fuel moisture monitoring. With respect to active fire detection and burnt area mapping, remote sensing applications can be considered operational. Active fire detection is mainly based on the use of midinfrared imagery acquired by polar orbital satellite sensors (e.g., AVHRR/ATSR and MODIS) or sensors onboard geostationary satellites (e.g., GOES or Meteosat). Burn scar mapping is based on the use of optical imagery of different spectral and spatial resolutions, but SAR images are also used in areas where persistent cloud coverage prevents the efficient use of optical imagery.},

	abstract = {13.1 Introduction The importance of fire activity on global atmo-spheric composition has been recognized since the late 1970s (Seiler and Crutzen, 1980). Its dramatic impact on air quality during extreme events has been further highlighted with extended fires and smoke haze episodes in Indonesia in 1997, resulting in increased hospital admissions and mortality (Heil and Goldammer, 2001). This particular event stressed the need for better mon-itoring of exposure, implying improved quantifi-cation of fire emissions and of their impact at local and regional scales. Much work has been dedicated to the analysis of the chemical compo-sition of fire plumes over recent decades, allow-ing comprehensive reviews of emission factors for the observed species (Andreae and Merlet, 2001). These reviews, coupled with the avail-ability of satellite observations of fire locations since the mid-1990s, have greatly facilitated the emergence of research on the large-scale vari-ability and impacts of fires. Wildfire emissions are composed of large amounts of trace gases and aerosols. Among the trace gases emitted, the most abundant (90–95\%) are carbon dioxide (CO 2) and carbon monoxide (CO), but also methane, a series of volatile organic carbon compounds (VOCs) and inorganic species. In addition to primary species, which are emitted directly into the atmosphere, secondary species may be formed by chemical reactions within the plumes, in particular ozone. The particulate matter (PM) is mainly emitted as fine (respirable) particles. These pollutants are monitored by air quality agencies worldwide for their impact on human health: while CO is a toxic gas at high concentration, exposure to PM contributes to the risk of developing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and ozone can cause breathing problems and lung diseases. Although their impact is most critical locally (dense smoke haze), many of these pollutants have a long enough residence time to travel sometimes thousands of kilometres, leading to large-scale modification of atmospheric composition. This has major conse-quences in terms of climate forcings due to large emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols, as well as the perturbation of the carbon cycle (particularly in the case of deforestation). The availability of more and more valuable surface and atmospheric observations, especially from satellites, and the advance of vegetation, general circulation and chemistry-transport mod-elling, allow quantitative evaluations and predic-tion of the impact of fires on both air quality and climate. These will represent both the transport of the emissions and the chemical and physical processes involved in the evolution of fire plumes. 13 Evaluating the Atmospheric Impact of Wildfires},

The estimates were based on a data base of large fires for the country and calculations of fuel consumption for each fire using the Canadian Forest Fire Behaviour Prediction System. This technique used the fire locations and start dates to estimate prevailing fire weather and fuel type for each of about 11 000 fires. An average of 2 x 10(6) ha.year(-1) was burned in this period, varying from 0.3 x 10(6) ha in 1978 to 7.5 x 10(6) ha in 1989. Ecozones of the boreal and taiga areas experienced the greatest area burned, releasing most of the carbon (C). The mean area-weighted fuel consumption for all fires was 2.6 kg dry fuel.m(-2) (1.3 kg C.m(-2)), but ecozones vary from 1.8 to 3.9 kg dry fuel.m(-2). The mean annual estimate of direct carbon emissions was 27 +/- 6 Tg C.year(-1). Individual years ranged from 3 to 115 Tg C.year(-1). These direct fire emissions represent about 18\% of the current carbon dioxide emissions from the Canadian energy sector, on average, but vary from 2 to 75\% among years. Post-fire effects cause an additional loss of carbon and changes to the forest sink condition.},

More specifically, the following topical areas are critically examined based on a comprehensive review of the pertinent literature: (i) estimating fireline intensity from flame length; (ii) substituting flame length for fireline intensity in Van Wagner's crown fire initiation model; (iii) the validity of linkages between the Rothermel surface fire behaviour and Van Wagner's crown scorch height models; (iv) estimating flame height from post-fire observations of stem-bark char height; and (v) estimating fireline intensity from post-fire observations of crown scorch height. There has been an overwhelming tendency within the wildland fire community to regard Byram's flame lengthfireline intensity and Van Wagner's crown scorch heightfireline intensity models as universal in nature. However, research has subsequently shown that such linkages among fire behaviour and post-fire impact characteristics are in fact strongly influenced by fuelbed structure, thereby necessitating consideration of fuel complex specific-type models of such relationships. © 2012 IAWF.},

	abstract = {New burned area datasets and top-down constraints from atmospheric concentration measurements of pyrogenic gases have decreased the large uncertainty in fire emissions estimates. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the contribution of deforestation, savanna, forest, agricultural waste, and peat fires to total global fire emissions. Here we used a revised version of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford-Approach (CASA) biogeochemical model and improved satellite-derived estimates of area burned, fire activity, and plant productivity to calculate fire emissions for the 19972009 period on a 0.5 spatial resolution with a monthly time step. For November 2000 onwards, estimates were based on burned area, active fire detections, and plant productivity from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. For the partitioning we focused on the MODIS era. We used maps of burned area derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) active fire data prior to MODIS (19972000) and estimates of plant productivity derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) observations during the same period. Average global fire carbon emissions according to this version 3 of the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED3) were 2.0 Pg C year1 with significant interannual variability during 19972001 (2.8 Pg C year1 in 1998 and 1.6 Pg C year1 in 2001). Globally, emissions during 20022007 were relatively constant (around 2.1 Pg C year1) before declining in 2008 (1.7 Pg C year1) and 2009 (1.5 Pg C year1) partly due to lower deforestation fire emissions in South America and tropical Asia. On a regional basis, emissions were highly variable during 20022007 (e.g., boreal Asia, South America, and Indonesia), but these regional differences canceled out at a global level. During the MODIS era (20012009), most carbon emissions were from fires in grasslands and savannas (44\%) with smaller contributions from tropical deforestation and degradation fires (20\%), woodland fires (mostly confined to the tropics, 16\%), forest fires (mostly in the extratropics, 15\%), agricultural waste burning (3\%), and tropical peat fires (3\%). The contribution from agricultural waste fires was likely a lower bound because our approach for measuring burned area could not detect all of these relatively small fires. Total carbon emissions were on average 13\% lower than in our previous (GFED2) work. For reduced trace gases such as CO and CH4, deforestation, degradation, and peat fires were more important contributors because of higher emissions of reduced trace gases per unit carbon combusted compared to savanna fires. Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation, degradation, and peatland fires were on average 0.5 Pg C year1. The carbon emissions from these fires may not be balanced by regrowth following fire. Our results provide the first global assessment of the contribution of different sources to total global fire emissions for the past decade, and supply the community with an improved 13-year fire emissions time series.},

Of particular interest was to evaluate the nature of the CBI–dNBR relationship from the perspectives of modelling, the influence of fire behaviour prediction (FBP) fuel type, and how field observations could be incorporated into the burn severity mapping process. A non-linear model form best represented the relationship between these variables for the fires evaluated, and a similar statistical performance was achieved when data from all fires were pooled into a single dataset. Results from this study suggest the potential to develop a single model for application over the western region of the boreal, but further evaluation is necessary. This evaluation could include stratification by FBP fuel type due to study results that document its apparent influence on dNBR values. A new approach for burn severity mapping was introduced by defining severity thresholds through field assessment of CBI, and from which development of new models could be incorporated directly into the mapping process.},

We used a spatially explicit population model that simulated population size in two kinds of patches. One patch had a corridor that connected it to a larger "source" patch and the other patch was unconnected and enlarged at the periphery by an area the same size as the corridor. Patch isolation, corridor width, patch size, and the probability that individuals would cross the border from habitat to matrix were varied independently. In general, population size was greater in enlarged patches than in connected patches when patches were relatively large and isolated. Corridor width and the probability of crossing the border from habitat to matrix did not affect the relative benefit of corridors versus patch enlargement. Although biological corridors may mitigate potential effects of inbreeding depression at long time scales, our results suggest that they are not always the best method of conserving fragmented populations.},

The capacity of each reservoir and the exchange rates are strongly diverse,  and because of this, depending on the considered time perspective, different “cycles” will  arise. At time scales of millions of years, carbon fluxes are slow and take place essentially  between the lithosphere and the “surface system”, these defining the long-term carbon  cycle, notably different to the more popular short-term carbon cycle (time scales of years  to centuries) which involves the fast fluxes occurring among the biosphere, the oceans,  the soils, and the atmosphere. Between the long- and the short-term cycles, many  
intermediate-scale situations appear which need of new cycle definitions according to time  scales.  
This review concentrates in the long-term carbon cycle, its controlling mechanisms and  its consequences during the environmental history of the Fanerozoic. Also, intermediate  time-scale carbon perturbations are considered, as the so-called hyperthermals and  
the Quaternary glaciations. A firm understanding of the carbon cycles from a geological  perspective is critical for understanding and evaluating the global perturbation that the  cycle is now experiencing, as well as its future consequences.},

Subduction zones are interior expressions of Earth's 55,000 km of convergent plate margins and are the geodynamic system that builds island arcs. Excess density of the mantle lithosphere in subduction zones provides most of the power needed to move the plates while inducing convection in the overriding mantle wedge. Asthenospheric mantle sucked toward the trench by the sinking slab interacts with water and incompatible elements rising from the sinking plate, and this interaction causes the mantle to melt. These melts rise vertically through downwelling mantle to erupt at arc volcanoes. Subduction zones are thus interior Earth systems of unparalleled scale and complexity. Subduction zone igneous activity formed most ore deposits and continental crust, and earthquakes caused by the downgoing plate present a growing hazard to society. This overview summarizes our present understanding of subduction zones, using perspectives of the incoming plate, downgoing plate, mantle wedge, and arc-trench complex. Understanding the operation of subduction zones stands as one of the great challenges facing the Earth sciences in the 21st century and will require the efforts of global interdisciplinary teams.},

	abstract = {Abstract Natural disasters do not affect people equally. In fact, a vulnerability approach to disasters would suggest that inequalities in exposure and sensitivity to risk as well as inequalities in access to resources, capabilities, and opportunities systematically disadvantage certain groups of people, rendering them more vulnerable to the impact of natural disasters. In this article we address the specific vulnerability of girls and women with respect to mortality from natural disasters and their aftermath. Biological and physiological differences between the sexes are unlikely to explain large-scale gender differences in mortality rates. Social norms and role behaviors provide some further explanation, but what is likely to matter most is the everyday socioeconomic status of women. In a sample of up to 141 countries over the period 1981 to 2002 we analyze the effect of disaster strength and its interaction with the socioeconomic status of women on the change in the gender gap in life expectancy. We find, first, that natural disasters lower the life expectancy of women more than that of men. In other words, natural disasters (and their subsequent impact) on average kill more women than men or kill women at an earlier age than men. Since female life expectancy is generally higher than that of males, for most countries natural disasters narrow the gender gap in life expectancy. Second, the stronger the disaster (as approximated by the number of people killed relative to population size), the stronger this effect on the gender gap in life expectancy. That is, major calamities lead to more severe impacts on female life expectancy (relative to that of males) than do smaller disasters. Third, the higher women's socioeconomic status, the weaker is this effect on the gender gap in life expectancy. Taken together our results show that it is the socially constructed gender-specific vulnerability of females built into everyday socioeconomic patterns that lead to the relatively higher female disaster mortality rates compared to men.},

	abstract = {Payments for ecosystem services (PES) have emerged as an incentive-based policy instrument to manage and secure the flow of ecosystem services for human wellbeing. PES implementation has been mostly examined in rural areas but very few studies have paid attention to experiences in rural-urban landscapes that provide critical ecosystem services for densely populated areas. Informed by household surveys and focus groups, we analyze the implementation of Mexico's federal program of Payments for Watershed Services (PSAH in Spanish) in two communities located in the rural-urban fringe of Mexico City, paying attention to landowners' dependence on ecosystem services and both perceived benefits and costs of participating in the PSAH program. We demonstrate that landowners are generally aware of the critical services they provide to the city and beyond but there is a skewed level of knowledge regarding the program objectives and an uneven sharing of its benefits. The latter is influenced by collective organization and environmental history, with higher knowledge and more equitable benefit sharing present in the community with a more long-standing commitment to forest conservation. The PSAH incentive contributes to household income but it is clearly insufficient to motivate strong family and collective action towards halting land-use change beyond the PSAH targeted area. We thus argue that conservation policy in urban-rural fringes needs to be accompanied by effective land-use planning at regional level. This should involve multiple stakeholders and the re-conceptualization of Mexico City surrounding agricultural lands and forests as spaces to be governed for the provision of ecosystem services rather than as areas over which the city can expand.},

Methods are suggested for indicating on these diagrams the statistical significance of apparent differences and the degree to which observational uncertainty and unforced internal variability limit the expected agreement between model-simulated and observed behaviors.

	abstract = {Achieving global food security is one of the major challenges of the coming decades. In order to tackle future food security challenges we must understand the past. This study presents a historical analysis of global food availability, one of the key elements of food security. By calculating national level dietary energy supply and production for nine time steps during 1965–2005 we classify countries based on their food availability, food self-sufficiency and food trade. We also look at how diets have changed during this period with regard to supply of animal based calories. Our results show that food availability has increased substantially both in absolute and relative terms. The percentage of population living in countries with sufficient food supply ({\textgreater}2500 kcal/cap/d) has almost doubled from 33\% in 1965 to 61\% in 2005. The population living with critically low food supply ({\textless}2000 kcal/cap/d) has dropped from 52\% to 3\%. Largest improvements are seen in the MENA region, Latin America, China and Southeast Asia. Besides, the composition of diets has changed considerably within the study period: the world population living with high supply of animal source food ({\textgreater}15\% of dietary energy supply) increased from 33\% to over 50\%. While food supply has increased globally, food self-sufficiency (domestic production{\textgreater}2500 kcal/cap/d) has not changed remarkably. In the beginning of the study period insufficient domestic production meant insufficient food supply, but in recent years the deficit has been increasingly compensated by rising food imports. This highlights the growing importance of food trade, either for food supply in importing countries or as a source of income for exporters. Our results provide a basis for understanding past global food system dynamics which, in turn, can benefit research on future food security.},

Vulnerability is the state of susceptibility to harm from exposure to stresses associated with environmental and social change and from the absence of capacity to adapt. Antecedent traditions include theories of vulnerability as entitlement failure and theories of hazard. Each of these areas has contributed to present formulations of vulnerability to environmental change as a characteristic of social-ecological systems linked to resilience. Research on vulnerability to the impacts of climate change spans all the antecedent and successor traditions. The challenges for vulnerability research are to develop robust and credible measures, to incorporate diverse methods that include perceptions of risk and vulnerability, and to incorporate governance research on the mechanisms that mediate vulnerability and promote adaptive action and resilience. These challenges are common to the domains of vulnerability, adaptation and resilience and form common ground for consilience and integration. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Crop trade can reduce the environmental burden on importing countries, which benefit from embedded environmental resources in imported crops, and from avoided environmental impacts of production in their territory. International trade can also reduce the universal environmental impact of food production if crops are grown where they are produced in the most environmentally efficient way.Wecompared production efficiencies for the same crops in the USand Mexico to determine whether current crop trade between these two countries provides an overall benefit to the environment. Oureconomic and environmental accounting for the key traded crops from 2010 to 2014 shows that exports to Mexico are just3\%(∼16 thousandGg) of the total production of these crops in the US, and exports toUSrepresent roughly 0.13\% (∼46 Gg) of Mexican total production of the same crops. Yields were higher inUSthan Mexico for all crops except wheat. Use of nitrogen fertilizer was higher inUSthan in Mexico for all crops except corn. Current trade reduces some, but not all, environmental costs of agriculture.Acounterfactual trade scenario showed that an overall annual reduction in cultivated land (∼371 thousand ha), water use (∼923 millionm3), fertilizer use (∼122 Gg;∼68 Ggnitrogen) and pollution (∼681 tonnes ofN2Oemissions to the atmosphere and∼511 tonnes of leached nitrogen) can be achieved by changing the composition of food products traded. In this case, corn, soybeans and rice should be grown in the US, while wheat, sorghum and barley should be grown in Mexico. Assigning greater economic weight to the environmental costs of agriculture might improve the balance of trade to be more universally beneficial, environmentally.},

	title = {Risks, vulnerabilities and resilience in a context of climate change},
	abstract = {Agricultural activities are by nature prone to risks and uncertainties of various nature, both biophysical, abiotic, climatic, environmental, biotic (pests, diseases) and economic. Many of these risks have a climatic component and most of them will be affected by climate change, either in intensity, scope or frequency. The aim of this paper is not to review the increasing literature on risks, on vulnerability 1 and on resilience. 2 It is to articulate these broad notions in such a way that they can be of use to frame an approach applicable to concrete issues in the agricultural and food systems. The impact of a risk depends on the shock itself and on the system to which it is applied. Depending on its vulnerability, the system will be more or less affected by the same shock. Depending on its resilience, it will recover more or less easily. Climate change is expected to modify risks, vulnerabilities and the conditions that shape the resilience of agriculture systems. Climate change is also introducing new uncertainties. Could building resilience to known risks be a way to build resilience to changing risks and to adapt to climate change? How to build strategies and policies for resilience of agriculture and related systems in the context of climate change? To consider these questions, one has first to clarify how these notions of risk, vulnerability and resilience are connected, how they apply to systems, and to interlinked systems, and how environmental (biophysical), economic and social perspectives can interact. Therefore, this paper aims towards a better understanding of "what adaptation means" and towards strategies to build resilience in making the following points: 1. Risks operate on systems and first one must have a good understanding of the systems to be considered. 2. Climatic risks and changes operate in the middle of all other risks, superpose with them and change them. 3. Before we come to "what we mean by resilience", we must explain the notion of vulnerability. To consider risks as they impact systems leads us to consider vulner-abilities. We will try to define what this notion covers and its dimensions. 4. Building resilience starts with reducing vulnerabilities: a system is more resilient if it is less vulnerable. But this is not enough. Resilience adds two dimensions: the 1 For a review on the notion of vulnerability, see Adger (2006) and Fellmann (2012). 2 For a review on resilience from an operational point of view, see Martin-Breen. and Anderies (2011).},

To this end, the study employs three different heterogeneous, dynamic mean group‐type linear panel models and one nonlinear panel data estimation procedure that allows for cross‐sectional dependence. While affluence, nonrenewable energy consumption and energy intensity variables are found to drive pollutant emissions in linear models, population is also found to be a significant driver in the nonlinear model. Both service sector and agricultural value‐added levels play a significant role in reducing pollution levels, whereas industrialisation increases pollution levels. Although the linear model fails to track any significant impact of trade openness, the nonlinear model finds trade liberalisation to significantly affect emission reduction levels. All of these results suggest that economic development, and especially industrialisation strategies and environmental policies, need to be coordinated to play a greater role in emission reduction due to trade liberalisation.},

The bounds test results indicate that there exist two forms of long-run relationships between the variables. In the case of first form of long-run relationship, carbon emissions are determined by energy consumption, income and foreign trade. In the case of second long-run relationship, income is determined by carbon emissions, energy consumption and foreign trade. An augmented form of Granger causality analysis is conducted amongst the variables. The long-run relationship of CO2emissions, energy consumption, income and foreign trade equation is also checked for the parameter stability.

	abstract = {A comprehensive assessment of the impacts of climate change on agro-ecosystems over this century is developed, up to 2080 and at a global level, albeit with significant regional detail. To this end an integrated ecological-economic modelling framework is employed, encompassing climate scenarios, agro-ecological zoning information, socioeconomic drivers, as well as world food trade dynamics. Specifically, global simulations are performed using the FAO/IIASA agro-ecological zone model, in conjunction with IIASAs global food system model, using climate variables from five different general circulation models, under four different socioeconomic scenarios from the intergovernmental panel on climate change. First, impacts of different scenarios of climate change on bio-physical soil and crop growth determinants of yield are evaluated on a 5 0 !5 0 latitude/longitude global grid; second, the extent of potential agricultural land and related potential crop production is computed. The detailed bio-physical results are then fed into an economic analysis, to assess how climate impacts may interact with alternative development pathways, and key trends expected over this century for food demand and production, and trade, as well as key composite indices such as risk of hunger and malnutrition, are computed. This modelling approach connects the relevant bio-physical and socioeconomic variables within a unified and coherent framework to produce a global assessment of food production and security under climate change. The results from the study suggest that critical impact asymmetries due to both climate and socioeconomic structures may deepen current production and consumption gaps between developed and developing world; it is suggested that adaptation of agricultural techniques will be central to limit potential damages under climate change.},

We need to estimate the effect of smoking on lung cancer, of education on salaries, of carbon emissions on the climate. Most ambitiously, we also need to understand how and why causes influence their effects, which is not less valuable. For example, knowing whether malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes or "mal-air," as many believed in the past, tells us whether we should pack mosquito nets or breathing masks on our next trip to the swamps. Less obvious is the answer to the question, "why study causation as a separate topic, distinct from the traditional statistical curriculum?" What can the concept of "causation," considered on its own, tell us about the world that tried-and-true statistical methods can't? Quite a lot, as it turns out. When approached rigorously, causation is not merely an aspect of statistics; it is an addition to statistics, an enrichment that allows statistics to uncover workings of the world that traditional methods alone cannot. For example, and this might come as a surprise to many, none of the problems mentioned above can be articulated in the standard language of statistics. To understand the special role of causation in statistics, let's examine one of the most intriguing puzzles in the statistical literature, one that illustrates vividly why the traditional language of statistics must be enriched with new ingredients in order to cope with cause-effect relationships , such as the ones we mentioned above.},

	abstract = {This article examines the historic and contemporary roots of chronic malnutrition and environmental degradation in the developing world. It chronicles the patterns of trade and production that contribute to this problem from the colonial period until the present, and analyzes the role of contemporary trade, aid and development practices in ameliorating or exacerbating the problem. The article argues that the neoliberal economic reforms imposed on developing countries through the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization (WTO) exacerbate hunger and environmental degradation by reinforcing pre-existing inequities in the global trading system that relegate many developing countries to the export of primary agricultural commodities as a means of generating the revenue with which to purchase food and manufactured goods. This economic specialization erodes food security by depressing domestic food production and by subjecting the export earnings needed to finance the import of food and other necessities to fluctuating world market prices for agricultural commodities and to the declining terms of trade for agricultural products. This economic specialization also degrades the environment by replacing biodiverse agroecosystems with monocultures that require massive application of pesticides and fertilizers. Furthermore, the structural adjustment policies of the IMF and World Bank, in conjunction with the reforms required under the WTO, have created a double standard in international agricultural trade that requires relative market openness in the developing world while permitting lavish subsidies and import-restrictive tariffs in industrialized countries. This double standard has depressed the export earnings of developing countries and has resulted in the widespread pauperization of small farmers in the developing world due to the influx of cheap subsidized food from developed countries. The article concludes with several recommendations designed to promote food security and sustainable rural development.},

We argue that the trade regime seems to evolve as a complex adaptive system, at the edge of order and chaos. Drawing from a dataset of 280 different types of environmental provisions found in 680 trade agreements, we show how both the trade regime and the norms contained therein unfold by remaining stable (but not static) and dynamic (but not chaotic). Trade negotiators simultaneously explore new grounds by introducing legal innovations and exploiting known territories by adopting existing norms. Our analysis suggests that, even as the regime grows in the number and length of agreements , there are exploratory and exploitative processes at work. These twin processes can explain that the trade regime appears neither more fragmented/heterogeneous nor more centralized/homogenous than it was 50 years ago, despite its substantial expansion. This hypothesis is at the core of the research agenda that this article lays out.},

Few global-scale assessments have been carried out, and these are limited in their ability to capture the uncertainty in climate projections, and omit potentially important aspects such as extreme events and changes in pests and diseases. There is a lack of clarity on how climate change impacts on drought are best quantified from an agricultural perspective, with different metrics giving very different impressions of future risk. The dependence of some regional agriculture on remote rainfall, snowmelt and glaciers adds to the complexity. Indirect impacts via sea-level rise, storms and diseases have not been quantified. Perhaps most seriously, there is high uncertainty in the extent to which the direct effects of CO 2 rise on plant physiology will interact with climate change in affecting productivity. At present, the aggregate impacts of climate change on global-scale agricultural productivity cannot be reliably quantified.},

A first set of papers explores the main factors affecting the demand for food (population growth, changes in consumption patterns, the effects on the food system of urbanization and the importance of understanding income distributions) with a second examining trends in future food supply (crops, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture, and 'wild food'). A third set explores exogenous factors affecting the food system (climate change, competition for water, energy and land, and how agriculture depends on and provides ecosystem services), while the final set explores cross-cutting themes (food system economics, food wastage and links with health). Two of the clearest conclusions that emerge from the collected papers are that major advances in sustainable food production and availability can be achieved with the concerted application of current technologies (given sufficient political will), and the importance of investing in research sooner rather than later to enable the food system to cope with both known and unknown challenges in the coming decades.},

	abstract = {Quantification of climate change impacts on food safety requires food safety assessment with different past and future climate scenario data to compare current and future conditions. This study presents a tool to prepare climate and climate change data for local food safety scenario analysis and illustrates how this tool can be used with impact models, such as bacterial and mycotoxin growth and pesticide models. As an example, coarse gridded data from two global climate models (GCMs), HadGEM2-ES and CCSM4, are selected and downscaled using the “Delta method” with quantile-quantile correction for Ukkel, Belgium. Observational daily temperature and precipitation data from 1981 to 2000 are used as a reference for this downscaling. Data are provided for four future representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for the periods 2031–2050 and 2081–2100. These RCPs are radiative forcing scenarios for which future climate conditions are projected. The climate projections for these RCPs show that both temperature and precipitation will increase towards the end of the century in Ukkel. The climate change data are then used with Ratkowsky's bacterial growth model to illustrate how projected climate data can be used for projecting bacterial growth in the future. In this example, the growth rate of Lactobacillus plantarum in Ukkel is projected to increase in the future and the number of days that the bacteria are able to grow is also projected to increase. This example shows that this downscaling method can be applied to assess future food safety. However, we only used two GCMs. To obtain a more realistic uncertainty range, using many different GCM output datasets and working directly with climate modellers is recommended. Our approach helps food safety researchers to perform their own climate change scenario analysis. The actual algorithm of the downscaling method and its detailed manual is available in the supplementary material.},

	abstract = {The paper is dedicated to examine the implications of agricultural trade liberalization within the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) for food security in Mexico. Since NAFTA implementation has almost 20 years of existence, the Mexican experience is relevant to draw lessons for other emerging economies in South East Asia involved in regional free trade agreements. Taking into consideration agricultural heterogeneity in Mexico at both production and regional levels, the main objective of the paper is to evaluate empirically the effect of NAFTA and domestic reforms on Mexico´s agricultural prices, production, trade and food security with special attention to Mexico´s non-competitive crops under NAFTA: grains and oilseeds and maize (the major food staple of Mexico). The study shows that some of the official expectations about the effects of NAFTA have not been realized: e.g. domestic production of maize has increased. In order to explain unexpected trends, I propose that particular reactions of subsistence household farmers to market-price changes and subsidies to commercial farmers producing staples explain unforeseen trends. With respect to food security during NAFTA, I find that per capita food consumption in Mexico has increased, partially at the expense of "import dependency" and "self-sufficiency". However, what causes concern is that income inequality and poverty prevails, meaning that food security has not been granted for all Mexicans. I conclude that food production and security can increase in Mexico by "reforming the reforms" in a market oriented and globalized context by a long run effective policy design that favors the provision of public goods and that integrates social policies with productive policies for rural households with a competitive potential.},

Leveraging Paulo Freire's concept of "Popular Education", we identify an opportunity to work on these issues in empowering ways through literacy education. We discuss existing definitions of data literacy and find a need to create an extended definition of Big Data literacy. Surveying existing approaches to building data literacy, we identify the need for new approaches and technologies to address the problematic aspects of Big Data projects. To flesh out this concept of "Popular Big Data", we close by oer-ing seven ideas for how the field can ensure that Big Data projects are in line with the values of organizations working in the social good sector.},

	abstract = {Understanding changes in precipitation variability is essential for a complete explanation of the hydrologic cycle’s response to warming and its impacts. While changes in mean and extreme precipitation have been studied intensively, precipitation variability has received less attention, despite its theoretical and practical importance. Here, we show that precipitation variability in most climate models increases over a majority of global land area in response to warming (66\% of land has a robust increase in variability of seasonal-mean precipitation). Comparing recent decades to RCP8.5 projections for the end of the 21st century, we find that in the global, multi-model mean, precipitation variability increases 3–4\% K−1 globally, 4–5\% K−1 over land and 2–4\% K−1 over ocean, and is remarkably robust on a range of timescales from daily to decadal. Precipitation variability increases by at least as much as mean precipitation and less than moisture and extreme precipitation for most models, regions, and timescales. We interpret this as being related to an increase in moisture which is partially mitigated by weakening circulation. We show that changes in observed daily variability in station data are consistent with increased variability.},

While detailed regional accounts of the effects of extreme weather disasters exist, the global scale effects of droughts, floods and extreme temperature on crop production are yet to be quantified. Here we estimate for the first time, to our knowledge, national cereal production losses across the globe resulting from reported extreme weather disasters during 1964–2007. We show that droughts and extreme heat significantly reduced national cereal production by 9–10\%, whereas our analysis could not identify an effect from floods and extreme cold in the national data. Analysing the underlying processes, we find that production losses due to droughts were associated with a reduction in both harvested area and yields, whereas extreme heat mainly decreased cereal yields. Furthermore, the results highlight {\textasciitilde}7\% greater production damage from more recent droughts and 8–11\% more damage in developed countries than in developing ones.

	abstract = {Historical weather records at eight American urban areas of varying size, type, and climate were studied for indications of inadvertent precipitation modification. The six largest cities all had experienced warm seasonal rainfall increases of 9 to 17\% during the 1955-70 period. The increases in the Midwest cities occurred largely with cold frontal systems, but in the coastal cities they were largely during air mass (non-frontal) conditions. The Midwest increases also were found to occur as enhancement , not initiation, of moderate to heavy rain days. Significant increases in summer thunder-day frequencies (13 to 41\%) and hail-day frequencies (90 to 450\%) were found at the six largest cities, and the increases occurred largely in the morning hours. The typical locations of maxima in the Midwest cities were thunder over and near the city, and rain and hail 25 to 55 km downwind. The maxima of all events in coastal cities were in or near the city. Overall, the results suggest that urban precipitation enhancement is related to city size, industrial nuclei generation, and urban thermal effects. The alterations have considerable relevance to urban design, local area forecasting, local water supplies, agricultural production, hydrologic design, and to planned weather modification.},

Wet season (May-October) rainfall for an urban site (Tacubaya) shows a significant trend for the period 1941-1985 suggesting an urban effect that has been increasing as the city grew. On the other hand, rainfall at a suburban (upwind) station apparently unaffected by urbanization, has remained unchanged. Analysis of historical records of hourly precipitation for an urban station shows that the frequency of intense ({\textgreater} 20 mm h-t) rain showers has increased in recent decades. Using a network of automatic rainfall stations, areal distribution of 24 h isoyets show a series of maxima within the urban perimeter which may be associated to the heat island phenomenon. Isochrones of the beginning of rain are used to estimate direction and speed of movement of the rain cloud cells. The daytime heat island seems to be associated with the intensification of rain showers.},

	abstract = {It is well established that anthropogenic land-use changes directly affect the atmospheric boundary layer at the mesoscale dimensions. Located in the high lands of Central Mexico, the basin of Mexico (7 500 km2) has undergone a widespread conversion of natural vegetation to urban and agricultural land by deforestation. While the urban extension of the capital city occupied 6\% of the basin in 1960, at the end of the twentieth century the urban sprawl had increased considerably to 20\% of the total area. This phenomenal growth has impacted on the thermal climate of substantial portions of the basin. In this paper using annual temperature and precipitation data for a 25 year period, an attempt is made to identify interdecadal climate changes. Results show that large areas of the basin have changed toward a warmer drier climate. While afternoon temperatures have increased at a rate of 0.07°C/yr in the suburbs of the city the corresponding area averaged value for the rural sites is somewhat less: 0.06°C/yr. The afternoon temperature increase for the total number of stations used was 0.06° C/yr. The area-averaged minimum temperature increase in suburban stations (3) was 0.15° C/yr while that corresponding to surrounding rural sites was 0.08°C/yr for period 1961-1985. This last result illustrates the relevant role the heat island phenomenon has had in changing the thermal climate as compared with that observed in the rural environment.},

Direct observation of the net radiation, sensible and latent heat flux densities above roof-top in the old city district of Mexico City allow the heat storage flux density to be found by residual. The most important finding is that during daytime, when evaporation is very small ((4\% of net radiation), and therefore sensible heat uses dominate (Bowen ratio'8), the uptake of heat by the buildings and substrate is so large (58\%) that convective heating of the atmosphere is reduced to a smaller role than expected (38\%). The nocturnal release of heat from storage is equal to or larger than the net radiation and sufficient to maintain an upward convective heat flux throughout most nights. It is important to see if this pattern is repeated at other central city, or dry urban sites, or whether it is only found in districts dominated by massive stone structures. These findings have implications for the height of the urban mixing layer and the magnitude of the urban heat island.},

It also alters habitat for biological diversity. Balancing the inherent trade-offs between satisfying immediate human needs and maintaining other ecosystems functions requires quantitative knowledge about ecosystem responses to land use. These responses vary according to the type of land-use change and the ecological setting, and have local, short term as wll as global, long-term effects. Land-use decisions ultimately weigh the need to satisfy human demands and the unintended ecosystem responses based on societal values, but ecological knowledge can provide a basis for assessing the trade-offs.},

	abstract = {The most populated state in the United States, California, is projected to add millions of new inhabitants through the end of the current century, requiring considerable landscape conversion to the built environment. A suite of continuous multiyear, medium-range resolution (20-km grid spacing), ensemble-based simulations is examined to assess urban expansion climate effects on California in 2100, and potential strategies to alleviate them. Summertime [June-August (JJA)] warming due to urban expansion of 18-28C is greater relative to any other season, and is completely offset by a range of adaptation strategies: green roofs (highly transpiring), cool roofs (highly reflective), and hybrid roofs (with combined biophysical properties of green and cool roofs). After offsetting of urban-induced warming, cool and hybrid roofs lead to a further 18-28C reduction in JJA 2-m temperature, highlighting enhanced efficacy of these adaptation strategies. Guided by medium-range-resolution results, additional high-resolution (2-km grid spacing) experiments are conducted for a subset of the JJA periods conducted on a coarser scale. Urban-induced 18-28C warming (local maximum warming exceeds 48C) is simulated, and is offset by cool and green roof deployment. In agreement with coarser-resolution results, maximum near-surface cooling is greater for cool roofs relative to green roofs. Reduced daytime warming associated with both cool and green roofs also modifies the convective mixed layer, reducing turbulent kinetic energy and planetary boundary layer height, although this impact is less for green roofs than for cool roofs. The results presented here demonstrate the importance of future urban expansion in California and illustrate climatic consequences with implications for regional air quality.},

The vast tracts of impervious roads, sidewalks, driveways, parking lots, roofs, and walls alter the surface energy budget and the hydrologic cycle. The most prominent characteristic of the urban climate is the urban heat island, by which air temperature in cities can be several degrees warmer than that of rural landscapes. The heat island arises due to reduced emission of longwave radiation by the city surface, much of which is trapped by tall buildings; the low surface albedo of cities; reduced latent heat flux and increased sensible heat flux because of greater impervious surface area; storage of heat in urban materials during the day that is released at night; and from anthropogenic heat sources within the city. Cities also generate more runoff compared with rural landscapes because of greater impervious surface area. Vegetated parks within cities ameliorate the urban heat island by reducing impervious surface area and allowing for infiltration and evaporation of rainfall.},

	abstract = {Changes in land cover and in human uses of land can influence climate. Conversion of forests and grasslands to agricultural land alters net radiation, the partitioning of this energy into sensible and latent heat, and the partitioning of precipitation into soil water, evapo-transpiration, and runoff. Among the surface characteristics altered by land-cover change are albedo, surface roughness, leaf area index, canopy conductance, root depth, and soil texture and structure. Land degradation in arid and semiarid climates increases surface albedo, reduces evapotranspiration, and may contribute to low rainfall in these regions. Extensive deforestation and land clearing have altered the climate of vast regions of Australia. Clearing of tropical forests for pastures creates a warmer, drier climate. Clearing of temperate forests and grasslands to cultivate crops cools climate, primarily because of higher albedo. However, the climate signal associated with crops is complicated and is related to the timing of crop planting , maturation, and harvesting relative to the phenology of natural vegetation. Irrigation leads to a cooler, moister climate. The influence of historical land-cover change on climate needs to be considered as a climate forcing in addition to traditional forcings such as greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar variability, and ozone. Climate model simulations show that the biogeophysi-cal effects of historical land-cover change have cooled climate over large regions of North America and Eurasia. This biogeophysical cooling is comparable to, but of opposite sign, greenhouse gas warming over the same period. This cooling primarily results from increases in surface albedo with deforestation. Conversions among forests, pastureland, and cropland are thought to have decreased annual evapotranspi-ration. The net effect of anthropogenic land use and land-cover change is the balance between these biogeophysical changes and carbon emission from land use. 28.2 Green Planets and Brown Planets Much of the natural vegetation of the world has been converted to cropland and range-land (Figure 2.8). Human uses of land such as cultivation, grazing, forest clearing, and forest regrowth on abandoned farmland alter net radiation, the partitioning of this available energy between sensible and latent heat, and the partitioning of precipitation into runoff and evapotranspiration. These changes occur from modifications of albedo, surface roughness, leaf area index, rooting depth, and canopy con-ductance and also from changes in soil texture and structure that affect soil water. Soil texture determines how much water is available for evapotranspiration. Soil compaction with over-grazing alters hydraulic properties and changes 28},

I examine an indigenous coffee cooperative to gauge the potential for sustainable and environmentally just development in Mexico as an alternative to transnational corporate agroindustry. The coffee farming model demonstrates the impossibility of escaping consumer capitalist markets that are steeped in paternalistic relations, destroy natural resources, and restrict personal freedoms. Overall, the implementation of NAFTA has resulted in massive land and food security problems for the rural campesino and indigena population in Chiapas and has contributed to ecological devastation.

	abstract = {On the eve of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), models predicted the transformation of Mexican agriculture, with imports precipitating the decline of domestic supply of staples, particularly corn, while fruit-and-vegetable exports drove sectoral growth. Trade flows have met expectations, but Mexican agriculture has not: both staple and specialty crops expanded during NAFTA's first decade, while their gross value declined; just as unexpectedly, their value has risen sharply since 2005. The Ministry of Agriculture (SAGARPA) has been credited with the apparent success of this export-led strategy, upholding the results-based management (RBM) of sectoral policy abetted by the National Council for the Evaluation of Social Development Policy (CONEVAL). This study offers a critical assessment of Mexican agricultural policy and its management in light of the sector's performance during the last 25 years. We report trends in the volume and value of agricultural output, land use, yields and prices. Using simple accounting methods, we show that price decreases accounted entirely for the sector's decline between 1993 and 2005. Since then, 67.0\% of staples' gross value growth has be linked to rising prices, 27.4\% to yield gains, and 5.6\% to land-use change. For fruits and vegetables, these figures are 27.3, 50.0 and 22.7\%. However, there is little evidence linking agricultural performance and policy. Only staple yields fall within policy's purview; yet yields of irrigated staples other than corn have stagnated this century. Additional evidence calls into question the success of RBM, including the dearth of diagnoses and impact evaluations supporting it. Their absence has not prevented constant reforms that systematically violate the integrity of the policy cycle. Official acknowledgement of drivers of growth will reveal the risks to Mexican agriculture, including its vulnerability to price fluctuations and reliance on select crops for growth. Academic engagement is a prerequisite for RBM's success. Highlights:  Having declined 31\% between 1993 and 2005, Mexican agricultural gross value increased 68\% (US\$4.9 billion) by 2016.  Of total growth, 54.4\% was linked to prices, 33.4\% to yields, and 12.2\% to land-use change, but no evidence yet links growth to policy.  Other evidence points to serious flaws in the results-based management (RBM) of Mexican agricultural policy.},

In doing so it seeks to work in close collaboration with the International Social Science Council (ISSC) and other partners. The pace and magnitude of human-induced global change is currently beyond human control and is manifest in increasingly dangerous threats to human societies and human well-being. There is an urgent need for the international scientific community to develop the knowledge that can inform and shape effective responses to these threats in ways that foster global justice and facilitate progress toward sustainable development goals. The global change research community, which has played a central role in understanding the functioning of the Earth system and the human impacts on that system, holds the promise to meet this need. Realizing that promise requires a focus on new research priorities, and on new ways of doing and using research to address needs at global, regional, national, and local scales. This report is the product of an international consultative process led by ICSU and its partners that was designed to: (a) identify broadly-accepted grand challenges in Earth system science for global sustainability; (b) identify high priority research that must be carried out to address those challenges; and (c) mobilize scholars in the sciences (social, natural, health, and engineering) and humanities to pursue that research.},

A key aspect of socio-hydrology is explicit inclusion of two-way feedbacks between human and water systems, which differentiates socio-hydrology from other inter-disciplinary disciplines dealing with water. We illustrate the potential of socio-hydrology through three examples of water sustainability problems, defined as paradoxes, which can only be fully resolved within a new socio-hydrologic framework that encompasses such two-way coupling between human and water systems.

We applied spatial statistics and multivariate regression analyses to high resolution records of gastrointestinal diseases during two time frames (2007–2009 and 2010–2014). Results show a pattern of significant association between water flooding events and disease incidence in the city center (lowlands). We also found that in the periphery (highlands), higher incidence is generally associated with household infrastructure deficiency. Our findings suggest the need for integrated and spatially tailored interventions by public works and public health agencies, aimed to manage socio-hydrological vulnerability in Mexico City. 1.},

	abstract = {Fast fashion, inexpensive and widely available of-the-moment garments, has changed the way people buy and dispose of clothing. By selling large quantities of clothing at cheap prices, fast fashion has emerged as a dominant business model, causing garment consumption to skyrocket. While this transition is sometimes heralded as the "democratization" of fashion in which the latest styles are available to all classes of consumers, the human and environmental health risks associated with inexpensive clothing are hidden throughout the lifecycle of each garment. From the growth of water-intensive cotton, to the release of untreated dyes into local water sources, to worker's low wages and poor working conditions; the environmental and social costs involved in textile manufacturing are widespread. In this paper, we posit that negative externalities at each step of the fast fashion supply chain have created a global environmental justice dilemma. While fast fashion offers consumers an opportunity to buy more clothes for less, those who work in or live near textile manufacturing facilities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental health hazards. Furthermore, increased consumption patterns have also created millions of tons of textile waste in landfills and unregulated settings. This is particularly applicable to low and middle-income countries (LMICs) as much of this waste ends up in second-hand clothing markets. These LMICs often lack the supports and resources necessary to develop and enforce environmental and occupational safeguards to protect human health. We discuss the role of industry, policymakers, consumers, and scientists in promoting sustainable production and ethical consumption in an equitable manner.},

In this paper we present a critical review of nexus approaches and identify potential linkages with sustainable livelihoods theory and practice, to deepen our understanding of the interrelated dynamics between human populations and the natural environment. Building upon this review, we explore the concept of 'environmental livelihood security' - which encompasses a balance between natural resource supply and human demand on the environment to promote sustainability - and develop an integrated nexus-livelihoods framework for examining the environmental livelihood security of a system. The outcome is an integrated framework with the capacity to measure and monitor environmental livelihood security of whole systems by accounting for the water, energy and food requisites for livelihoods at multiple spatial scales and institutional levels. We anticipate this holistic approach will not only provide a significant contribution to achieving national and regional sustainable development targets, but will also be effective for promoting equity amongst individuals and communities in local and global development agendas.},

However, application and implementation of nexus approaches are in their infancy. No studies have explicitly quantified the contributions of nexus approaches to progress toward meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. To further implement nexus approaches and realize their potential, we propose a systematic procedure and provide perspectives on future directions.

	abstract = {Natural disasters do not affect people equally. In fact, a vulnerability approach to disasters would suggest that inequalities in exposure and sensitivity to risk as well as inequalities in access to resources, capabilities, and opportunities systematically disadvantage certain groups of people, rendering them more vulnerable to the impact of natural disasters. In this article we address the specific vulnerability of girls and women with respect to mortality from natural disasters and their aftermath. Biological and physiological differences between the sexes are unlikely to explain large-scale gender differences in mortality rates. Social norms and role behaviors provide some further explanation, but what is likely to matter most is the everyday socioeconomic status of women. In a sample of up to 141 countries over the period 1981 to 2002 we analyze the effect of disaster strength and its interaction with the socioeconomic status of women on the change in the gender gap in life expectancy. We find, first, that natural disasters lower the life expectancy of women more than that of men. In other words, natural disasters (and their subsequent impact) on average kill more women than men or kill women at an earlier age than men. Since female life expectancy is generally higher than that of males, for most countries natural disasters narrow the gender gap in life expectancy. Second, the stronger the disaster (as approximated by the number of people killed relative to population size), the stronger this effect on the gender gap in life expectancy. That is, major calamities lead to more severe impacts on female life expectancy (relative to that of males) than do smaller disasters. Third, the higher women's socioeconomic status, the weaker is this effect on the gender gap in life expectancy. Taken together our results show that it is the socially constructed gender-specific vulnerability of females built into everyday socioeconomic patterns that lead to the relatively higher female disaster mortality rates compared to men.},

However, the water-energy-food security nexus concept has mostly been analyzed at higher scales in a top-down manner, while examples of bottom-up and local scale applications remain limited. Breaching this gap, the research presented in this paper describes and assesses the water-energy-food nexus from a smallholder farm household perspective in the context of rural Ethiopia through a gender-specific lens. We adopted the “Actors, Resources, Dynamics and Interactions” participatory approach to co-develop a mental model of this nexus concept. Using this approach, we were able to examine the key elements and interlinkages among major nexus related resources that affect management according to gender. The results indicate that there are four aspects that differentiate between male and female farm household management with respect to the water-energy-food nexus. These differences include gender specific productive roles, perceptions of target resources, access to external actors, and decision making with respect to target resource management and utilization, which may affect the dynamics and governance of important components of the water-energy-food nexus.},

	abstract = {Diets link environmental and human health. Rising incomes and urbanization are driving a global dietary transition in which traditional diets are replaced by diets higher in refined sugars, refined fats, oils and meats. By 2050 these dietary trends, if unchecked, would be a major contributor to an estimated 80 per cent increase in global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions from food production and to global land clearing. Moreover, these dietary shifts are greatly increasing the incidence of type II diabetes, coronary heart disease and other chronic non-communicable diseases that lower global life expectancies. Alternative diets that offer substantial health benefits could, if widely adopted, reduce global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, reduce land clearing and resultant species extinctions, and help prevent such diet-related chronic non-communicable diseases. The implementation of dietary solutions to the tightly linked diet-environment-health trilemma is a global challenge, and opportunity, of great environmental and public health importance. Agriculture is having increasingly strong global impacts on both the environment 1-5 and human health, often driven by dietary changes 6-9. Global agriculture and food production release more than 25\% of all greenhouse gases (GHGs) 2-4 , pollute fresh and marine waters with agro-chemicals 1,5 , and use as cropland or pastureland about half of the ice-free land area of Earth 10. Despite the intensity and impacts of global agriculture , almost a billion people still suffer from inadequate diets and insecure food supplies 11-13. Moreover, the global transition towards diets high in processed foods, refined sugars, refined fats, oils and meats has contributed to 2.1 billion people becoming overweight or obese 6,14. These dietary shifts and resulting increases in body mass indices (BMI) are associated with increased global incidences of chronic non-communicable diseases, especially type II diabetes, coronary heart disease and some cancers 7-9,15-22 , which are predicted to become two-thirds of the global burden of disease if dietary trends continue 9,16,17. In China, for instance, as incomes increased and diets changed 20 , the incidence of type II diabetes increased from ,1\% of its population in 1980 to 10\% in 2008, partly because type II diabetes occurs at lower BMI levels and earlier in an individual's life in Asian than in western populations 9. Moreover, diet-driven increases in global food demand 7,8,12,23 and increases in population are leading to clearing of tropical forests, savannas and grasslands 1,5,23 , which threatens species with extinction 1,3-5,23-25. Because it directly links and negatively affects human and environmental health, the global dietary transition is one of the great challenges facing humanity. Meaningful solutions will not be easily achieved. Solutions will require analyses of the quantitative linkages between diets, the environment and human health, on which we focus here, and the efforts of nutritionists, agriculturists, public health professionals, educators , policy makers and food industries. Here we compile and analyse global-level data to quantify relationships among diet, environmental sustainability and human health, evaluate potential future environmental impacts of the global dietary transition and explore some possible solutions to the diet-environment-health trilemma (Methods and Supplementary Information). To do so, we first expand on earlier food lifecycle analyses 24,25 (LCAs) by searching for all published LCAs of GHG emissions of food crop, livestock, fishery and aquaculture production systems that delimited the full 'cradle to farm gate' portion of the food/crop lifecycle. Next we use about 50 years of data for 100 of the world's more populous nations to analyse global dietary trends and their drivers, then use this information to forecast future diets should past trends continue. To quantify effects of alternative diets on mortality and on type II diabetes, cancer and chronic coronary heart disease, we compile and summarize results of studies encompassing ten million person-years of observations on diet and health. Finally, we combine these relationships with projected increases in global population to forecast global environmental implications of current dietary trajectories and to calculate the environmental benefits of diets associated with lower incidences of chronic non-communicable diseases. Lifecycle environmental impacts of foods Dietary composition strongly influences GHG emissions 2, 24-27. The 120 LCA publications that met our criteria report a total of 555 LCA analyses on 82 types of crops and animal products, allowing us to calculate diet-related GHG emissions per gram protein, per kilocalorie and per serving from 'cradle to farm gate' (Fig. 1; Methods, Extended Data Tables 1-3). We express emissions as CO 2 warming equivalents, in grams (g) or gigatonnes (Gt) of CO 2 carbon equivalents (CO 2-C eq). GHG emissions vary widely among foods (Fig. 1; Extended Data Table 3 lists means, s.e.m. and number of data points). As is well known, relative to animal-based foods, plant-based foods have lower GHG emissions. This difference can be large; the largest we found was that ruminant meats (beef and lamb) have emissions per gram of protein that are about 250 times those of legumes (Extended Data Table 3; Student's t-test comparison of means: P , 0.0001). Eggs, dairy, non-trawling seafood, traditional (non-recirculating) aquaculture, poultry and pork all have much lower emissions per gram of protein than ruminant meats (Tukey range test comparing ruminant meats with each other item: P , 0.0001 for each comparison). However, when sustainably grazed on lands unsuitable for cropping and fed crop residues, ruminant dairy and meat production can increase food security, dietary quality, and provide environmental benefits via nutrient cycling 28,29. How a given food is produced can also affect emissions. Seafood caught by trawling, in which nets are often dragged across the ocean floor, has emissions per gram of protein about 3 times those of non-trawling seafood (Fig. 1; Extended Data Table 3; t-test mean comparison: P 5 0.017).

	abstract = {Energy demand for urban water supply is emerging as a significant issue. This work undertakes a multi-city time-series analysis of the direct energy use for urban water supply. It quantifies the energy use and intensity for water supply in 30 cities (total population of over 170 million) and illustrates their performance with a new time-based water-energy profiling approach. Per capita energy use for water provision ranged from 10 kWh/p/a (Melbourne in 2015) to 372 kWh/p/a (San Diego in 2015). Raw water pumping and product water distribution dominate the energy use of most of these systems. For 17 cities with available time-series data (between 2000 and 2015), a general trend in reduction of per capita energy use for water provision is observed (11\%–45\% reduction). The reduction is likely to be a result of improved water efficiency in most of the cities. Potential influencing factors including climate, topography, operational efficiency and water use patterns are explored to understand why energy use for water provision differs across the cities, and in some cities changes substantially over time. The key insights from this multi-city analysis are that i) some cities may be considered as benchmarks for insight into management of energy use for water provision by better utilising local topography, capitalising on climate events, improving energy efficiency of supply systems, managing non-revenue water and improving residential water efficiency; ii) energy associated with non-revenue water is found to be very substantial in multiple cities studied and represents a significant energy saving potential (i.e. a population-weighted average of 16 kWh/p/a, 25\% of the average energy use for water provision); and iii) three Australian cities which encountered a decade-long drought demonstrated the beneficial role of demand-side measures in reducing the negative energy consequences of system augmentations with seawater desalination and inter-basin water transfers.},

Despite significant effort to quantify the interdependence of the water and energy sectors, global requirements of energy for water (E4W) are still poorly understood, which may result in biases in projections and consequently in water and energy management and policy. This study estimates water-related energy consumption by water source, sector, and process for 14 global regions from 1973 to 2012. Globally, E4W amounted to 10.2 EJ of primary energy consumption in 2010, accounting for 1.7\%-2.7\% of total global primary energy consumption, of which 58\% pertains to fresh surface water, 30\% to fresh groundwater, and 12\% to nonfresh water, assuming median energy intensity levels. The sectoral E4W allocation includes municipal (45\%), industrial (30\%), and agricultural (25\%), and main process-level contributions are from source/conveyance (39\%), water purification (27\%), water distribution (12\%), and wastewater treatment (18\%). While the United States was the largest E4W consumer from the 1970s until the 2000s, the largest consumers at present are the Middle East, India, and China, driven by rapid growth in desalination, groundwater-based irrigation, and industrial and municipal water use, respectively. The improved understanding of global E4W will enable enhanced consistency of both water and energy representations in integrated assessment models.},

	abstract = {Understanding environmental impacts of complete food supply chains is important for the food industry to help devise strategies for reducing the impacts of current and future products. Breakfast cereals are one of the most important foods consumed in many countries, but their environmental impacts are currently unknown. Therefore, this study explores the environmental sustainability issues in the food-energy-water nexus by considering breakfast cereals manufactured by one of the world's largest producers, Kellogg Europe. A life cycle assessment has been carried out for these purposes with the aim of helping the Company to integrate environmental sustainability considerations into the design of their products and packaging. The results indicate that the average global warming potential (GWP) of Kellogg's breakfast cereals is 2.64 kg CO2 eq. per kg of product. The main GWP hotspots are the ingredients (48\%) and energy used in the manufacturing process (23\%); packaging and transport contribute 15\% each. Rice is the single largest contributor to the GWP of the ingredients (38\%). The manufacturing stage is the main contributor of primary energy demand (34\%), while the ingredients are responsible for more than 90\% of the water footprint. The ingredients are also the main contributors to most other environmental impacts, including land use (97\%), depletion of elements (61\%), eutrophication (71\%), human toxicity (54\%) and photochemical smog (50\%). The impacts from packaging are high for freshwater and marine toxicity. The contribution of transport is significant for depletion of elements and fossil resources (23\%), acidification (32\%), ozone depletion (28\%) and photochemical smog (24\%). Improvement opportunities explored in the paper include better agricultural practices, recipe modifications, improved energy efficiency of manufacturing processes and use of alternative packaging. Impacts from consumption are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Evaluations of food, energy and water (FEW) linkages are rapidly emerging in contemporary nexus studies. This paper demonstrates, from a food consumption perspective, the potential of life cycle thinking in understanding the complex and often “hidden” linkages between FEW systems. Our study evaluates the upstream virtual water and embodied energy in food consumption in the Tamar catchment, South West England, distinguishing between domestic production and imports origin. The study also evaluates key inputs, including virtual nutrients and animal feed, when tracking supply chain of food products. Based on current dietary patterns and food products selection, the catchment consumes annually 834 TJ, 17 hm 3 and 244 hm 3 of energy, blue water and green water, respectively. Tamar is not self-sufficient in terms of food and requires imports of food products, as well as imports of virtual nutrients and animal feed for local production. Consequently, 51\% of the embodied energy and 88\% blue and 45\% green virtual water in food consumed within the catchment are imported. Most of the embodied energy (58\%) and green virtual water (90\%) are because of animal feed production, where nearly half of embodied energy (48\%) and green virtual water (42\%) come from imports. 92\% of blue virtual water is used for irrigation and primarily happens elsewhere due to imports. Irrigation is the process that demands the largest amount of energy for the crop-based products, with 38\% of their total energy demand, followed by fertilisers production (24\%). Our study illustrates water and energy hotspots in the food life cycle and highlights potential FEW risks and trade-offs through trade. This is useful considering potential unexpected changes in trade under recent global socio-political trends. Currently available databases and software make LCA a key tool for integrated FEW nexus assessments.},

Farms under 2 ha devote a greater proportion of their production to food, while farms over 1000 ha have the greatest proportion of waste.

While agricultural expansion has been heavily scrutinized, less attention has been paid to changes within cropland systems. Here we present a method to detect individual cropland field parcels from temporal Landsat imagery to improve cropland estimates and better depict the scale of farming across South America. The methods consist of multi-spectral image edge extraction and multi-scale contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) and adaptive thresholding using Landsat Surface Reflectance Climate Data Record (CDR) products. We tested our methods across a South American region with approximately 82\% of the 2000/2001 total cropland area, using a Landsat time series composite with a January 1, 2000 to August 1, 2001 timeframe. A thematic accuracy assessment revealed an overall cropland f-score of 91\%, while an object-based assessment of 5480 fields showed low geometric errors. The results illustrate that Landsat time series can be used to accurately estimate cropland in South America, and the low geometric errors of the per-parcel estimates highlight the applicability of the proposed methods over a large area. Our approach offers a new technique of analyzing agricultural changes across a broad geographic scale. By using multi-temporal Landsat imagery with a semi-automatic field extraction approach, we can monitor within-agricultural changes at a high degree of accuracy, and advance our understanding of regional agricultural expansion and intensification dynamics across South America.},

	abstract = {Copyright © 2017 The Author(s). Global agriculture is facing growing challenges at the nexus of interconnected food, energy and water systems, including but not limited to persistent food insecurity and diet-related diseases; growing demands for energy and consequences for climate change; and declining water resources, water pollution, floods and droughts. Further, soil degradation and biodiversity loss are both triggers for and consequences of these problems. In this commentary, we argue that expanding agroecological principles, tools, and technologies and enhancing biological diversity can address these challenges and achieve better socioeconomic outcomes. Agroecology is often described as multi- or transdiscplinary, and applies ecological principles to the design and management of agricultural systems through scientific research, practice and collective action. While agroecology has roots in the study of food systems, agricultural land use has many direct and indirect linkages to water and energy systems that could benefit from agroecological insights, including use of water resources and the development of bio-based energy products. Although opportunities from the science and the practice of agroecology transcend national boundaries, obstacles to widespread adoption vary. In this article, we therefore focus on the United States, where key barriers include a shortage of research funds, limited supporting infrastructure, and cultural obstacles. Nevertheless, simply scaling up current models of agricultural production and land use practices will not solve many of the issues specific to food related challenges nor would such an approach address related energy and water concerns. We conclude that a first critical step to discovering solutions at the food, energy, water nexus will be to move past yield as a sole measure of success in agricultural systems, and call for more holistic considerations of the co-benefits and tradeoffs of different agricultural management options, particularly as they relate to environmental and equity outcomes.},

For this reason, energy use in the production of conventional and organic milk and rye bread in Finland was studied by conducting a life cycle inventory (LCI). The product systems of milk and rye bread consisted of farming, production of fuels, electricity and fertilisers, as well as the processing phases of milk and bread, i.e. the dairy and the bakery. Transportation of fuels, raw materials and the final products was also taken into account. Primary energy consumption was 6.4 GJ in average conventional milk production and 4.4 GJ in average organic milk production, calculated per 1000 l of milk. For rye bread the values were 15.3 GJ (conventional) and 13.3 GJ (organic) per 1000 kg of rye bread. The proportion of renewable energy in the product systems studied varied between 7 and 16\% of the total primary energy use, being somewhat higher in organic production. In milk production, energy use efficiency can be increased by favouring organic production. Making changes in the energy use patterns of bakeries would be the fastest way to affect the energy profile of bread, because bakery is responsible for 70 and 80\% of the total energy consumption in conventional and organic bread production, respectively. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Phoenix MSA comprises of two of the fastest growing counties in United States. The study finds that with half density panel distribution, private agricultural lands in the APS (Arizona Public Service) service territory can generate about 8 times the current residential energy demand and 3.4 times the current total energy requirements of the residential, commercial and industrial sectors in the MSA. The Indian Reservation land in the SRP (Salt River Project) service territory has the capacity to generate all of the current residential energy requirement. Most of the agricultural land lies within 1 mile of the 230 and 500 kV transmission lines and is capable of producing 137.5 and 77.5 million MWh of energy. However, with half density panel distribution, an agricultural land received about 60\% of direct sunlight compared to a land with no panels. Farmlands have the capacity to generate energy which is significantly more than that required for crop production. Analysis shows that about 50\% of the agricultural land sales would have made up for the price of the sale within 2 years with agrivoltaic systems.

	abstract = {The expansion of renewable energies aims at meeting the global energy demand while replacing fossil fuels. However, it requires large areas of land. At the same time, food security is threatened by the impacts of climate change and a growing world population. This has led to increasing competition for limited land resources. In this context, the combination of photovoltaics and plant production — often referred to as agrophotovoltaic (APV) or agrivoltaic systems — has been suggested as an opportunity for the synergistic combination of renewable energy and food production. Although this technology has already been applied in various commercial projects, its practicability and impact on crop production have hardly been investigated. In this review, we give a short summary of the current state of the art and prospective opportunities for the application of APV systems. In addition, we discuss microclimatic alterations and the resulting impacts of APV on crop production. Our main findings are that (1) crop cultivation underneath APV can lead to declining crop yields as solar radiation is expected to be reduced by about one third underneath the panels. However, microclimatic heterogeneities and their impact on crop yields are missing reference and thus, remain uncertain. (2) Through combined energy and crop production, APV can increase land productivity by up to 70\%. (3) Given the impacts of climate change and conditions in arid climates, potential benefits are likely for crop production through additional shading and observed improvements of water productivity. (4) In addition, APV enhances the economic value of farming and can contribute to decentralized, off-grid electrification in developing and rural areas, thus further improving agricultural productivity. As such, APV can be a valuable technical approach for more sustainable agriculture, helping to meet current and prospective needs of energy and food production and simultaneously sparing land resources.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Power demands are set to increase by two-fold within the current century and a high fraction of that demand should be met by carbon free sources. Among the renewable energies, solar energy is among the fastest growing; therefore, a comprehensive and accurate design methodology for solar systems and how they interact with the local environment is vital. This paper addresses the environmental effects of solar panels on an unirrigated pasture that often experiences water stress. Changes to the microclimatology, soil moisture, water usage, and biomass productivity due to the presence of solar panels were quantified. The goal of this study was to show that the impacts of these factors should be considered in designing the solar farms to take advantage of potential net gains in agricultural and power production. Microclimatological stations were placed in the Rabbit Hills agrivoltaic solar arrays, located in Oregon State campus, two years after the solar array was installed. Soil moisture was quantified using neutron probe readings. Significant differences in mean air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and soil moisture were observed. Areas under PV solar panels maintained higher soil moisture throughout the period of observation. A significant increase in late season biomass was also observed for areas under the PV panels (90\% more biomass), and areas under PV panels were significantly more water efficient (328\% more efficient).},

	abstract = {Most of the water humans consume is for agriculture. Rapidly increasing water demand has led to overexploitation of water resources in many important food-producing regions. In particular, growing groundwater-based irrigation causes potentially damaging depletion. Food systems are increasingly globalized, leading to large export-oriented production. Much research has focused on quantifying the amount of water resources embedded in traded products, but less attention has been given to the role of groundwater use and the related sustainability of agriculture globally. We assess current knowledge of virtual water trade in light of groundwater use and sustainability and highlight remaining challenges in this field.Increasing pressure on water resources globally is mostly driven by irrigation. The use of non-renewable groundwater for irrigation is estimated to have tripled from 1960 to 2000, now making up approximately 20\% of irrigation globally. This leads to fast aquifer depletion in many regions, which is a major concern as groundwater can provide an alternative source during droughts, which are expected to become more frequent under climate change. Importantly, water resources management is a local issue, but global trade strongly links producing regions to remote locations of consumption. Much research has analysed global patterns of virtual water trade – measuring the water consumed to produce traded food and highlighting the dependence of some nations’ food supplies on others’ water resources. Recently, concern regarding the sustainability of water use has emerged in this field, and many challenges remain, including groundwater sustainability estimates. We analyse how the consideration of different water sources and water sustainability has emerged in virtual water trade studies, describe the challenges and advances in evaluating the water sustainability of agriculture globally and recommend topics for future research: distinguish groundwater from other irrigation sources while considering all sources; exploit new modelling and data opportunities to improve estimates of groundwater storage and dynamics; and better integrate ecological needs for water.},

	abstract = {© 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. The insufficiency of water resources to meet the needs of food production is a pressing issue that is likely to increase in importance in the future. Improved understanding of historical developments can provide a basis for addressing future challenges. In this study we analyse how hydroclimatic variation, cropland expansion and evolving agricultural practices have influenced the potential for food self-sufficiency within the last century. We consider a food production unit (FPU) to have experienced green-blue water (GBW) scarcity if local renewable green (in soils) and blue water resources (in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, aquifers) were not sufficient for producing a reference food supply of 3000 kcal with 20\% animal products for all inhabitants. The number of people living in FPUs affected by GBW scarcity has gone up from 360 million in 1905 (21\% of world population at the time) to 2.2 billion (34\%) in 2005. During this time, GBW scarcity has spread to large areas and become more frequent in regions where it occurs. Meanwhile, cropland expansion has increased green water availability for agriculture around the world, and advancements in agronomic practices have decreased water requirements of producing food. These efforts have improved food production potential and thus eased GBW scarcity considerably but also made possible the rapid population growth of the last century. The influence of modern agronomic practices is particularly striking: if agronomic practices of the early 1900s were applied today, it would roughly double the population under GBW scarcity worldwide.},

	abstract = {Water availability is a major factor constraining humanity's ability to meet the future food and energy needs of a growing and increasingly affluent human population. Water plays an important role in the production of energy, including renewable energy sources and the extraction of unconventional fossil fuels that are expected to become important players in future energy security. The emergent competition for water between the food and energy systems is increasingly recognized in the concept of the “food‐energy‐water nexus.” The nexus between food and water is made even more complex by the globalization of agriculture and rapid growth in food trade, which results in a massive virtual transfer of water among regions and plays an important role in the food and water security of some regions. This review explores multiple components of the food‐energy‐water nexus and highlights possible approaches that could be used to meet food and energy security with the limited renewable water resources of the planet. Despite clear tensions inherent in meeting the growing and changing demand for food and energy in the 21st century, the inherent linkages among food, water, and energy systems can offer an opportunity for synergistic strategies aimed at resilient food, water, and energy security, such as the circular economy.},

While the notion of such a nexus is compelling to some observers, interactions involving water, energy, and food have been known and studied for many years by scientists and policy analysts. The need for greater integration of research and policy discourse across sectors and regions has been expressed in international meetings since the late 1940s. In addition, the conceptual basis for including water, energy, and food in the “nexus,” to the exclusion of other resources and inputs is not evident. In many cases, the information excluded from studies claiming to implement a nexus approach might be of greater importance to science and policy than the information included in the analysis. In this paper, I review some of the experience gained in earlier attempts to enhance integration and policy coherence, and to promote systems analysis. The challenges observed in implementing programs of integrated natural resources management (INRM) and integrated water resources management (IWRM), in particular, suggest that efforts to implement a water-energy-food nexus approach will not enhance the policy process in all settings. In sum, it is not clear that the increasing attention given to studies claiming to implement a nexus approach is warranted.},

Adoption occurs when the landholder perceives that the innovation in question will enhance the achievement of their personal goals. A range of goals is identifiable among landholders, including economic, social and environmental goals. Innovations are more likely to be adopted when they have a high ‘relative advantage’ (perceived superiority to the idea or practice that it supersedes), and when they are readily trialable (easy to test and learn about before adoption). Non-adoption or low adoption of a number of conservation practices is readily explicable in terms of their failure to provide a relative advantage (particularly in economic terms) or a range of difficulties that landholders may have in trialing them.},

Producing food in sufficient quantity and of sufficient quality, ensuring enough but not too much water, and generating energy, all to meet human needs and desires, requires an understanding of how those goals complement or counteract one another in specific places and through specific processes. FEW nexus research focuses on understanding the interconnections among each system, in order to provide a more complete picture about the causes and consequences of changes within and across aspects of those systems. This paper synthesizes the current state of thinking and research in FEW nexus field. We first overview the systems underpinnings of the FEW nexus as a conceptual framework, and identify the assumptions, similarities and contrasts among the most cited models from current literature. Several analytical approaches – coupled systems, ecosystem services, flows and risk analysis – are emerging as key tools for conducting interdisciplinary FEW nexus research, and we identify their conceptual connections to systems thinking broadly as well as the specific assumptions that each make about the relationships among systems. Finally, based on expert consultations and assessment of current data availability, we highlight several topical areas of contemporary relevance for FEW nexus research at various scales.

	abstract = {As arguably the world's most widely used numerical weather prediction model, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model offers a spectrum of capabilities for an extensive range of applications. T he Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model (Skamarock et al. 2008) is an atmospheric model designed, as its name indicates, for both research and numerical weather prediction (NWP). While it is officially supported by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), WRF has become a true community model by its long-term development through the interests and contributions of a worldwide user base. From these, WRF has grown to provide specialty capabilities for a range of Earth system prediction applications, such as air chemistry , hydrology, wildland fires, hurricanes, and regional climate. The software framework of WRF has facilitated such extensions and supports efficient, massively-parallel computation across a broad range of computing platforms. As detailed below, this paper aims to provide a review of the WRF system and to convey to the meteorological community its significance via its contributions to atmospheric science and weather prediction. AUGUST 2017 AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY {\textbar} Since its initial public release in 2000, WRF has become arguably the world's most-used atmospheric model. This is evidenced in metrics of registered users and publications. For example, the cumulative number of WRF registrations is now over 36,000, 1 distributed across 162 countries. Figure 1 (left) shows WRF's steady growth in cumulative registrations since its initial release, while Fig. 2 maps the countries that have logged registered users (as well as those that have had operational forecasting users). WRF's widespread acceptance is in part due to its being provided without cost, copyright encumbrance, or restrictions on modification. A measure of the ongoing interest in WRF and the influx of users is the number of annual registrations (Fig. 1, left). These averaged over 3,600 per year in the five years from 2011 to 2015. Meanwhile 8,200 users subscribe to the wrf-news e-mail for model information and updates. The catalog of WRF-related publications reflects the model's impact on science. The number of peer-reviewed journal publications involving WRF is currently over 3,500, and the annual average for the 2011-15 period is 510 per year (Fig. 1, right). The number of unique institutions on peer-reviewed WRF publications is over 1,340, and the number of unique authors exceeds 11,700. To date, the number of citations to WRF papers is over 26,500, with an average of over 10 citations per publication. Though WRF is mature, it continues to advance. The system is being vigorously applied in new research directions, real-time settings, and marketplace opportunities. In light of WRF's continuing growth, its prominent role in research, and its extensive use in forecasting, this article seeks to review this major NWP capability in order to inform and update the meteorological community on the current scope of the system, how it is being applied, and where it is going.},

	abstract = {Urban adaptation to climate change is likely to emerge from the responses of residents, authorities, and infrastructure providers to the impact of flooding, water scarcity, and other climate-related hazards. These responses are, in part, modulated by political relationships under cultural norms that dominate the institutional and collective decisions of public and private actors. The legacy of these decisions, which are often associated with investment in hard and soft infrastructure, has lasting consequences that influence current and future vulnerabilities. Making those decisions visible, and tractable is, therefore, an urgent research and political challenge in vulnerability assessments. In this work, we present a modeling framework to explore scenarios of institutional decision-making and socio-political processes and the resultant effects on spatial patterns of vulnerability. The approach entails using multi-criteria decision analysis, agent-based models, and geographic information simulation. The approach allows for the exploration of uncertainties, spatial patterns, thresholds, and the sensitivities of vulnerability outcomes to different policy scenarios. Here, we present the operationalization of the framework through an intentionally simplified model example of the governance of water in Mexico City. We discuss results from this example as part of a larger effort to empirically implement the framework to explore sociohydrological risk patterns and trade-offs of vulnerability in real urban landscapes.},

	abstract = {The paper demonstrates the relationship existing between the size of a village, town or city (as measured by its population), and the magnitude of the urban heat island it produces. This is accomplished by analyzing data gathered by automobile traverses in 10 settlements on the St. Lawrence Lowland, whose populations range from 1000 to 2 million inhabitants. The locations of these settlements effectively eliminate all non-urban climatic influences. The results are compared with previously published data. The analysis shows the heat island intensity under cloudless skies to be related to the inverse of the regional windspeed, and the logarithm of the population. A simple model is derived which incorporates these controls. In agreement with an extension of Summers' model the heat island appears to be approximately proportional to the fourth root of the population. With calm and clear conditions the relation is shown to hold remarkably well for North American settlements, and in a slightly modified form, for European towns and cities. © 1973.},

The surface-energy budget effects may be more important than the carbon-cycle effects.

A new metric is needed to quantify the human disturbance of the Earth's surface-energy budget. This 'regional climate change potential' could offer a new metric for developing a more inclusive climate protocol. This concept would also implicitly provide a mechanism to monitor potential local-scale environmental changes that could influence biodiversity.},

	doi = {10.5751/es-09712-230101},
	abstract = {Infrastructure development is central to the processes that abate and produce vulnerabilities in cities. Urban actors, especially those with power and authority, perceive and interpret vulnerability and decide when and how to adapt. When city managers use infrastructure to reduce urban risk in the complex, interconnected city system, new fragilities are introduced because of inherent system feedbacks. We trace the interactions between system dynamics and decision-making processes over 700 years of Mexico City’s adaptations to water risks, focusing on the decision cycles of public infrastructure providers (in this case, government authorities). We bring together two lenses in examining this history: robustness-vulnerability trade-offs to explain the evolution of systemic risk dynamics mediated by feedback control, and adaptation pathways to focus on the evolution of decision cycles that motivate significant infrastructure investments. Drawing from historical accounts, archeological evidence, and original research on water, engineering, and cultural history, we examine adaptation pathways of humans settlement, water supply, and flood risk. Mexico City’s history reveals insights that expand the theory of coupled infrastructure and lessons salient to contemporary urban risk management: (1) adapting by spatially externalizing risks can backfire: as cities expand, such risks become endogenous; (2) over time, adaptation pathways initiated to address specific risks may begin to intersect, creating complex trade-offs in risk management; and (3) city authorities are agents of risk production: even in the face of new exogenous risks (climate change), acknowledging and managing risks produced endogenously may prove more adaptive. History demonstrates that the very best solutions today may present critical challenges for tomorrow, and that collectively people have far more agency in and influence over the complex systems we live in than is often acknowledged.},

	abstract = {There is increasing observational evidence that urban land cover can have a significant effect on precipitation variability. Atlanta, because of its rapid urbanization, has been a focus for several observational studies on urbanization and rainfall. Yet, there is a lack of numerical model studies in the literature to examine physical processes linked to the Atlanta "urban rainfall effect" or URE. This study employs the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model to simulate convective precipitation for two cases: 17 August 2002 ("an urban interaction case") and 26th July 1996 (an urban "initiation" case). Case 1 was chosen based on analysis of radar composites and surface maps which identified it as an event likely to have some urban forcing with minimal large scale forcing; while Case 2 was based on a previous observational study indicating that the storm was initiated by urban heat island induced convergence zone. The control (URBAN) simulations begin 3 h prior to the observed storm initiations and reveal that the model captures the convective evolution of the cases. The alternative (NOURBAN) simulations indicate that removing the city of Atlanta causes distinct differences in the temporal and spatial evolution of the explicitly resolved precipitation. However these differences point more to the likelihood of modification rather than initiation of the convective systems. Time series of cumulative rainfall totals indicate that the explicitly resolved rainfall is initiated at the same time in both the URBAN and NOURBAN simulations. The rainfall initiation time even within sub-sections of the domain is the same for the URBAN and NOURBAN scenario. Rainfall amounts downwind of the city are higher by 10\% to 13\% within a strip 20-50 km east of the city, for the URBAN schemes in comparison to NOURBAN. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Climate extremes, such as droughts or heat waves, can lead to harvest failures and threaten the livelihoods of agricultural producers and the food security of communities worldwide. Improving our understanding of their impacts on crop yields is crucial to enhance the resilience of the global food system. This study analyses, to our knowledge for the first time, the impacts of climate extremes on yield anomalies of maize, soybeans, rice and spring wheat at the global scale using sub-national yield data and applying a machine-learning algorithm. We find that growing season climate factors-including mean climate as well as climate extremes-explain 20\%-49\% of the variance of yield anomalies (the range describes the differences between crop types), with 18\%-43\% of the explained variance attributable to climate extremes, depending on crop type. Temperature-related extremes show a stronger association with yield anomalies than precipitation-related factors, while irrigation partly mitigates negative effects of high temperature extremes. We developed a composite indicator to identify hotspot regions that are critical for global production and particularly susceptible to the effects of climate extremes. These regions include North America for maize, spring wheat and soy production, Asia in the case of maize and rice production as well as Europe for spring wheat production. Our study highlights the importance of considering climate extremes for agricultural predictions and adaptation planning and provides an overview of critical regions that are most susceptible to variations in growing season climate and climate extremes.},

New generation of multi-scale models and integrated urban services are needed. a b s t r a c t The rapid urbanization and growing number of megacities and urban complexes requires new types of research and services that make best use of science and available technology. With an increasing number of humans now living in urban sprawls, there are urgent needs of examining what the rising number of megacities means for air pollution, local climate and the effects these changes have on global climate. Such integrated studies and services should assist cities in facing hazards such as storm surge, flooding, heat waves, and air pollution episodes, especially in changing climates. While important advances have been made, new interdisciplinary research studies are needed to increase our understanding of the interactions between emissions, air quality, and regional and global climates. Studies need to address both basic and applied research and bridge the spatial and temporal scales connecting local emissions and air pollution and local weather, global atmospheric chemistry and climate. This paper reviews the current status of studies of the complex interactions between climate, air quality and megacities, and identifies the main gaps in our current knowledge as well as further research needs in this important field of research.},

Calling for a more explicit qualitative focus on housing and the urban environment, the policy shift is a welcome development. Mexico urbanised more rapidly than most OECD countries in the past half-century, in part as a result of the expansion of housing finance led by INFONAVIT and facilitated by policies aiming to expand access to formal housing. Yet the quantitative push for formal housing came with quantitative costs: inefficient development patterns resulting in a hollowing out of city centres and the third-highest rate of urban sprawl in the OECD; increasing motorisation rates; a significant share of vacant housing, with one-seventh of the housing stock uninhabited in 2010; housing developments with inadequate access to public transport and basic urban services; and social segregation. How can the Mexican authorities "get cities right" and develop more competitive, sustainable and inclusive cities? How can they improve the capacity of the relevant institutions and foster greater collaboration among them?

La tendencia a las inundaciones más frecuentes en México en las últimas décadas no es solo el resultado de precipitaciones más intensas, sino también una consecuencia de una mayor vulnerabilidad. Como un elemento multifactorial, la vulnerabilidad es un factor de modulación de baja frecuencia de la dinámica de riesgo a las precipitaciones intensas. Se puede describir en términos de factores físicos, sociales y económicos. Por ejemplo, las áreas deforestadas o urbanizadas son los factores físicos y sociales que conducen al deterioro de las cuencas hidrográficas y una mayor vulnerabilidad a las lluvias intensas. El aumento de la vulnerabilidad de las cuencas hidrográficas debido a los cambios en la cobertura de la tierra es el factor principal que conduce a más inundaciones, particularmente en el centro-sur de México. Solo en algunas partes del país, como Baja California Sur, la mayor frecuencia de lluvias intensas (es decir, riesgo natural) asociadas con los ciclones tropicales de alta intensidad es la principal causa de inundaciones más frecuentes.Hemos desarrollado una metodología para estimar el riesgo de inundación asociado a fuertes lluvias considerando los cambios en la cobertura y el uso de la tierra, la pendiente del terreno y la compacidad de la cuenca como factores clave de vulnerabilidad. La capacidad del modelo de riesgo de inundación para México se probó al comparar la frecuencia observada y modelada de las inundaciones para el período 1970-2010. Se encontró que en la mayor parte del territorio mexicano, las inundaciones más frecuentes son el resultado de un proceso rápido de deforestación. En consecuencia, la gestión del riesgo de inundación debe incluir medidas estructurales, como la restauración de cuencas hidrográficas y la planificación del uso de la cubierta terrestre.},

	abstract = {Agricultural practices are widespread in the periurban zones of developing countries. For periurban poor population, agriculture represents a complement to family income and an alternative for food supplies. For these peoples, the role of UPA (Urban and Periurban Agriculture) is very important. In Latin America, operation of periurban spaces has differentiated functions and roles: most of their inhabitants face conditions of marginalization or at best, subsist through the food self-production. Periurban poors are facing a double situation: the degradation of their activity and the transformation of their peasant condition; at the time, a conflict by the dispute for the space with other social groups, with different interests and meanings. In this paper we discuss about diverse manifestations of territorial restructuration in a global context, specifically in periurban areas of metropolitan system of Central Mexico. Above all, its interest lies in an analysis of these transformations within the context of the old rural spaces, those which have been affected by the advance of urbanization. The development of periurban agriculture in some cities of Central Mexico has established important patterns of territory transformation, either in changes of use of land or in the structure of production, or in social and cultural changes. Periurban agriculture is one of the several activities in this territory, that remains with another non-farming activities, mainly manufactures and tertiary, that are having an quick diffusion.},

We calibrate the model with historical data that are extracted from a time series of satellite images. We design three specific scenarios to simulate the spatial consequences of urban growth under different environmental conditions. The first scenario is to simulate the continued growth trend by maintaining unchanged the current conditions. The second scenario is to project the growth trend by taking into consideration road development and environmental protection. The third scenario is to simulate the development trend by slowing down growth and changing growth pattern. The first two scenarios demonstrate that unchecked urban growth would result in the displacement of almost the entire natural vegetation and all of the open space in the metro area. In contrast, the result from the third scenario shows that much more greenness and open space, including buffer zones of large streams and lakes, could be preserved. Accordingly, the last scenario should be the most desirable for the future urban growth of Atlanta. We also examine the model's effectiveness as applied to the Atlanta area and suggest future research directions for more accurate simulations.},

	abstract = {The SLEUTH model (slope, landuse, exclusion, urban extent, transportation and hillshade), formerly called the Clarke Cellular Automaton Urban Growth Model, was developed for and tested on various cities in North America, including Washington, DC, and San Francisco. In contrast, this research calibrated the SLEUTH model for two European cities, the Portuguese metropolitan areas of Lisbon and Porto. The SLEUTH model is a cellular automaton model, developed with predefined growth rules applied spatially to gridded maps of the cities in a set of nested loops, and was designed to be both scaleable and universally applicable. Urban expansion is modeled in a modified two-dimensional regular grid. Maps of topographic slope, land use, exclusions, urban extents, road transportation, and a graphic hillshade layer form the model input. This paper examines differences in the model's behavior when the obviously different environment of a European city is captured in the data and modeled. Calibration results are included and interpreted in the context of the two cities, and an evaluation of the model's portability and universality of application is made. Questions such as scalability, sequential multistage optimization by automated exploration of model parameter space, the problem of equifinality, and parameter sensitivity to local conditions are explored. The metropolitan areas present very different spatial and developmental characteristics. The Lisbon Metropolitan Area (the capital of Portugal) has a mix of north Atlantic and south Mediterranean influences. Property is organized in large patches of extensive farmland comprised of olive and cork orchards. The urban pattern of Lisbon and its environs is characterized by rapid urban sprawl, focused in the urban centers of Lisbon, Oeiras, Cascais Setúbal, and Almada, and by intense urbanization along the main road and train lines radiating from the major urban centers. The Porto Metropolitan Area is characterized by a coastal Atlantic landscape. The urban pattern is concentrated among the main nuclei (Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia) and scattered among many small rural towns and villages. There are very small isolated patches of intensive agriculture and pine forests in a topography of steep slopes. These endogenous territorial characteristics go back in time to the formation of Portugal - with a "Roman-Visigod North" and an "Arabic South" [Firmino, 1999 (Firmino, A., 1999. Agriculture and landscape in portugal. Landscape and Urban planning, 46, 83-91); Ribeiro, Lautensach, \& Daveau, 1991 (Ribeiro, O., Lautensach, H., \& Daveau, S., 1991. Geografia de portugal (4 Vols., published between 1986 and 1991). Lisbon, Portugal: João Sá de Costa)]. The SLEUTH model calibration captured these city characteristics, and using the standard documented calibration procedures, seems to have adapted itself well to the European context. Useful predictions of growth to 2025, and investigation of the impact of planning and transportation construction can be investigated as a consequence of the successful calibration. Further application and testing of the SLEUTH model in non-Western environments may prove it to be the elusive universal model of urban growth, the antithesis of the special case urban models of the 1960s and 1970s. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Shortage of land for waste disposal is a serious and growing potential problem in most large urban regions. However, no practical studies have been reported in the literature that incorporate the process of consumption and depletion of landfill space in urban regions over time and analyse its implications for the management of waste. An evaluation of existing models of waste management indicates that they can provide significant insights into the design of solid waste management activities. However, these models do not integrate spatial and temporal aspects of waste disposal that are essential to understand and measure the problem of shortage of land. The lack of adequate models is caused in part due to limitations of the methodologies the existing models are based upon, such as limitations of geographic information systems (GIS) in handling dynamic processes, and the limitations of systems analysis in incorporating spatial physical properties. This indicates that new methods need to be introduced in waste management modelling. Moreover, existing models generally do not link waste management to the process of urban growth. This paper presents a model to spatially and dynamically model the demand for and allocation of facilities for urban solid waste disposal in growing urban regions. The model developed here consists of a loose-coupled system that integrates GIS (geographic information systems) and cellular automata (CA) in order to give it spatial and dynamic capabilities. The model combines three sub-systems: (1) a CA-based model to simulate spatial urban growth over the future; (2) a spread-sheet calculation for designing waste disposal options and hence evaluating demand for landfill space over time; and (3) a model developed within a GIS to evaluate the availability and suitability of land for landfill over time and then simulate allocation of landfills in the available land. The proposed model has been tested and set up with data from a real source (Porto Alegre City, Brazil), and has successfully assessed the demand for landfills and their allocation over time under a range of scenarios of decision-making regarding waste disposal systems, urban growth patterns and land evaluation criteria. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {SLEUTH is a computational simulation model that uses adaptive cellular automata to simulate the way cities grow and change their surrounding land uses. It has long been known that models are of most value when calibrated, and that using back- casting (testing against known prior data) is an effective calibration method. SLEUTHs calibration uses the brute force method: every possible combination and permutation of its control parameters is tried, and the outcomes tested for their success at replicating prior data. Of the SLEUTH calibration approaches tried so far, there have been several suggested rules to follow during the brute force procedure to deal with problems of tractability, most of which leave out many of the possible parameter combinations. In this research, we instead attempt to create the complete set of possible outcomes with the goal of examining them to select the optimum from among the millions of possibilities. The self-organizing map (SOM) was used as a data reduction method to pursue the isolation of the best parameter sets, and to indicate which of the existing 13 calibration metrics used in SLEUTH are necessary to arrive at the optimum. As a result, a new metric is proposed that will be of value in future SLEUTH applications. The new measure combines seven of the current measures, eight if land use is modeled, and is recommended as a way to make SLEUTH applications more directly comparable, and to give superior modeling and forecasting results.},

	abstract = {Environmental disasters, ranging from catastrophic floods to extreme temperatures, have caused more than 30,000 deaths per year and more than US\$ 250–300 billion a year in economic losses, globally, between 1995 and 2015 (1). Improved infrastructure and planning for extreme events is essential in urban areas, where an increasingly greater fraction of the world’s inhabitants reside. In response, international governmental and private initiatives have placed the goal of resilience at the center stage of urban planning. [For example, The 100 Resilient Cities Initiative (www.100resilientcities.org/); the Global Covenant of Mayors (https://www.compactofmayors.org/globalcovenantofmayors/); and the recent UN Habitat III (https://habitat3.org/the-new-urban-agenda)]. In addition, scientific and policy communities alike now recognize the need for “safe-to-fail” infrastructural design, and the potential role of green and blue infrastructure in mediating hydrological and climatic risks in cities (2). Fig. 1. Improving urban resilience could help cities better cope with natural disasters, such as neighborhood flood events in Mexico City pictured here. Data source: Unidad Tormenta, Sistema de Aguas de la Ciudad de México. Nevertheless, the social and political norms, values, rules, and relationships that undergird and structure the myriad decisions made by public and private actors—what we call “socio-political infrastructure”—are likely to be as influential in urban vulnerability dynamics as “hard” infrastructure and environmental management. Urban planning for enhanced resilience and sustainability is ultimately a complex social and political process. Socio-political infrastructure creates patterns of behavior and action that shape the built environment. Developing more sustainable pathways of urban development hinges on making this socio-political infrastructure transparent and legible in the tools and approaches available for risk management. We argue that sustainability science is in the position to create the tools, methods, and strategies to identify, represent, and communicate the significance of these social and political processes to decision makers at all levels.

We illustrate how three key themes that are currently addressed separately in the urban sustainability and land change literatures can lead to incorrect conclusions and misleading results when they are not examined jointly: the traditional system of land classification that is based on discrete categories and reinforces the false idea of a rural-urban dichotomy; the spatial quantification of land change that is based on place-based relationships, ignoring the connections between distant places, especially between urban functions and rural land uses; and the implicit assumptions about path dependency and sequential land changes that underlie current conceptualizations of land transitions. We then examine several environmental "grand challenges" and discuss how urban land teleconnections could help research communities frame scientific inquiries. Finally, we point to existing analytical approaches that can be used to advance development and application of the concept.},

In 1950, 30 \% of the world's population was urban, and by 2050, 68 \% of the world's population is projected to be urban. • Today, the most urbanized regions include Northern America (with 82 \% of its population living in urban areas in 2018), Latin America and the Caribbean (81 \%), Europe (74 \%) and Oceania (68\%). The level of urbanization in Asia is now approximating 50 \%. In contrast, Africa remains mostly rural, with 43 \% of its population living in urban areas. • The rural population of the world has grown slowly since 1950 and is expected to reach its peak in a few years. The global rural population is now close to 3.4 billion and is expected to rise slightly and then decline to around 3.1 billion in 2050. Africa and Asia are home to nearly 90 \% of the world's rural population. India has the largest rural population (893 million), followed by China (578 million). • The urban population of the world has grown rapidly since 1950, having increased from 751 million to 4.2 billion in 2018. Asia, despite being less urbanized than most other regions today, is home to 54 \% of the world's urban population, followed by Europe and Africa (13 \% each). • Growth in the urban population is driven by overall population increase and by the upward shift in the percentage living in urban areas. Together, these two factors are projected to add 2.5 billion to the world's urban population by 2050, with almost 90 \% of this growth happening in Asia and Africa. • Just three countries-India, China and Nigeria-together are expected to account for 35 \% of the growth in the world's urban population between 2018 and 2050. India is projected to add 416 million urban dwellers, China 255 million and Nigeria 189 million. • Close to half of the world's urban dwellers reside in settlements with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants, while around one in eight live in 33 megacities with more than 10 million inhabitants. By 2030, the world is projected to have 43 megacities, most of them in developing regions. • Tokyo is the world's largest city with an agglomeration of 37 million inhabitants, followed by Delhi with 29 million, Shanghai with 26 million, and Mexico City and São Paulo, each with around 22 million inhabitants. Today, Cairo, Mumbai, Beijing and Dhaka all have close to 20 million inhabitants. • Some cities have experienced population decline in recent years. Most of these are located in the low-fertility countries of Asia and Europe where overall population sizes are stagnant or declining. Economic contraction and natural disasters have contributed to population losses in some cities as well. Sustainable urbanization is key to successful development • As the world continues to urbanize, sustainable development depends increasingly on the successful management of urban growth, especially in low-income and lower-middle-income countries where the most rapid urbanization is expected between now and 2050. Integrated policies to improve the lives of both urban and rural dwellers are needed, strengthening the linkages between urban and rural areas and building on their existing economic, social and environmental ties. • Urban growth is closely related to the three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. Well-managed urbanization, informed by an understanding of population trends over the long run, can help to maximize the benefits of agglomeration while minimizing environmental degradation and other potential adverse impacts of a growing number of city dwellers. • To ensure that the benefits of urbanization are shared and that no one is left behind, policies to manage urban growth need to ensure access to infrastructure and social services for all, focusing on the needs of the urban poor and other vulnerable groups for housing, education, health care, decent work and a safe environment.},

In addition, the control parameters of the model are allowed to self-modify: that is, the CA adapts itself to the circumstances it generates, in particular, during periods of rapid growth or stagnation. In addition, the model was written to allow the accumulation of probabilistic estimates based on Monte Carlo methods. Calibration of the model has been accomplished by the use of historical maps to compare model predictions of urbanization, based solely upon the distribution in year 1900, with observed data for years 1940, 1954, 1962, 1974, and 1990.

Validation of model results is predominantly based on locational accuracy assessment, while a small fraction of the applications assessed the accuracy of the generated land-use or land-cover patterns. Of the reviewed model applications, thirty-one percent did not report any validation. We argue that to mature as a scientific tool, and to gain credibility for scenario studies and policy assessments, the validation of land-change models requires consideration of challenges posed by uncertainty, complexity, and non-stationarity of land-change processes, and equifinality and multifinality of land-change models.},

We found that 65\% of the restaurants are measuring amounts of food waste and more than three-quarters of them (84\%) use compost bins to dispose inedible food waste. Our survey results also show that the most common method employed to dispose of food waste (72\%) was giving edible leftovers to restaurant's employees. However, three-quarters of restaurants avoided food donation because of unfounded fear of the legal liability. Finally, 14\% of surveyed restaurants dumped their food waste into landfill bins.

It is argued that reputation is distinct from legitimacy and that the immediate actions undertaken by an organisation during a crisis are related to reputation management. Using a qualitative case study approach, a thematic analysis of BP's social and environmental disclosures on its website during the time period of this incident (April 21 – September 19, 2010) was undertaken to enable an understanding of the reputation risk management activities of BP. The key findings of this research revealed that BP used social and environmental disclosures on its website extensively to manage its reputation risk arising from the Gulf of Mexico crisis. The company was engrossed in providing accounts of its world class facilities and superior quality of management, diverting attention away from the severe environmental damage caused by the massive oil spill. It was observed that BP consistently used the corrective actions strategy by disclosing extensive information about its plans to solve the problem, and not its actual social and environmental actions during the disaster. The predominant reputation managing strategy used was the bolstering strategy, whereby BP stressed on its good traits when disclosing its social and environmental actions during the crisis.},

While much of the resilience agenda has been shaped by policies and discourses from the global North, its applicability for cities of the global South, particularly African cities, has not been sufficiently assessed. Focusing on rights of urban citizens as the object to be made resilient, rather than physical and ecological infrastructures, may help to address many of the root causes that characterize the unacceptable risks that urban residents face on a daily basis. Linked to this idea, we discuss four entry points for grounding a rights and justice orientation for urban resilience. First, notions of resilience must move away from narrow, financially oriented risk analyses. Second, opportunities must be created for “negotiated resilience”, to allow for attention to processes that support these goals, as well as for the integration of diverse interests. Third, achieving resilience in ways that do justice to the local realities of diverse urban contexts necessitates taking into account endogenous, locally situated processes, knowledges and norms. And finally, urban resilience needs to be placed within the context of global systems, providing an opportunity for African contributions to help reimagine the role that cities might play in these global financial, political and science processes.},

In particular climate change and the concomitant increase of extreme weather events has exposed the inability of current governance regimes to deal with present and future challenges. Still our knowledge about resource governance regimes and how they change is quite limited. This paper develops a conceptual framework addressing the dynamics and adaptive capacity of resource governance regimes as multi-level learning processes. The influence of formal and informal institutions, the role of state and non-state actors, the nature of multi-level interactions and the relative importance of bureaucratic hierarchies, markets and networks are identified as major structural characteristics of governance regimes. Change is conceptualized as social and societal learning that proceeds in a stepwise fashion moving from single to double to triple loop learning. Informal networks are considered to play a crucial role in such learning processes. The framework supports flexible and context sensitive analysis without being case study specific. First empirical evidence from water governance supports the assumptions made on the dynamics of governance regimes and the usefulness of the chosen approach. More complex and diverse governance regimes have a higher adaptive capacity. However, it is still an open question how to overcome the state of single-loop learning that seem to characterize many attempts to adapt to climate change. Only further development and application of shared conceptual frameworks taking into account the real complexity of governance regimes can generate the knowledge base needed to advance current understanding to a state that allows giving meaningful policy advice. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, we apply an interdisciplinary perspective to describing key aspects of social-ecological transformations scholarship around three pressing questions: (1) What features or criteria distinguish transformations from other forms of change?; (2) What are the political, ethical, and normative concerns associated with transformations?; and (3) How can we better track, measure, and evaluate such transformations? Our insights, which emerged from a workshop with early-career interdisciplinary scholars, highlight questions of justice, equity and ethics in transformations research, and suggest that more precise indicators of change, a more explicit understanding of system boundaries, and a dual focus on process and outcomes will help advance our understanding of the social-ecological implications of transformations. We hope that articulating these challenges and recommendations in an interdisciplinary framing will help further the conversation on these critical topics and provide an accessible perspective of key considerations for multidisciplinary scholarship on social-ecological transformations.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. It is argued that the problem of pattern and scale is the central problem in ecology, unifying population biology and ecosystems science, and marrying basic and applied ecology. Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study of ecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range of scales will have unique causes and biological consequences. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. Examples are given from the marine and terrestrial literatures.},

The accumulated effects of many individual and household decisions have major negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem health. Human behavioral science blends psychology and economics to understand how people respond to the context in which they make decisions (eg who presents the information and how it is framed). Behavioral insights have informed new strategies to improve personal health and financial choices. However, less is known about whether and how these insights can encourage choices that are better for the environment. We review 160 experimental interventions that attempt to alter behavior in six domains in which decisions have major environmental impacts: family planning, land management, meat consumption, transportation choices, waste production, and water use. The evidence suggests that social influence and simple adjustments to decision settings can influence pro-environmental decisions. We identify four important gaps in the evidence that provide opportunities for future research. To address these gaps, we encourage collaborations between researchers and practitioners that look at the effects of embedding tests of behavior-change interventions within environmental programs.},

Nudges might also be ineffective, and less effective than expected, for five other reasons: (1) some nudges produce confusion in the target audience; (2) some nudges have only short-term effects; (3) some nudges produce “reactance” (though this appears to be rare); (4) some nudges are based on an inaccurate (though initially plausible) understanding on the part of choice architects of what kinds of choice architecture will move people in particular contexts; and (5) some nudges produce compensating behavior, resulting in no net effect. When a nudge turns out to be insufficiently effective, choice architects have three potential responses: (1) do nothing; (2) nudge better (or differently); and (3) fortify the effects of the nudge, perhaps through counter-counternudges, or perhaps through incentives, mandates, or bans.},

The purpose of this paper is to show that this narrow view of human motivation may severely limit understanding the determinants and effects of incentives. Economists may fail to understand the levels and the changes in behaviour if they neglect motives like the desire to reciprocate or the desire to avoid social disapproval. We show that monetary incentives may backfire and reduce the performance of agents or their compliance with rules. In addition, these motives may generate very powerful incentives themselves. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Summary: The benefits of organic farming to biodiversity in agricultural landscapes continue to be hotly debated, emphasizing the importance of precisely quantifying the effect of organic vs. conventional farming. We conducted an updated hierarchical meta-analysis of studies that compared biodiversity under organic and conventional farming methods, measured as species richness. We calculated effect sizes for 184 observations garnered from 94 studies, and for each study, we obtained three standardized measures reflecting land-use intensity. We investigated the stability of effect sizes through time, publication bias due to the 'file drawer' problem, and consider whether the current literature is representative of global organic farming patterns. On average, organic farming increased species richness by about 30\%. This result has been robust over the last 30 years of published studies and shows no sign of diminishing. Organic farming had a greater effect on biodiversity as the percentage of the landscape consisting of arable fields increased, that is, it is higher in intensively farmed regions. The average effect size and the response to agricultural intensification depend on taxonomic group, functional group and crop type. There is some evidence for publication bias in the literature; however, our results are robust to its impact. Current studies are heavily biased towards northern and western Europe and North America, while other regions with large areas of organic farming remain poorly investigated. Synthesis and applications. Our analysis affirms that organic farming has large positive effects on biodiversity compared with conventional farming, but that the effect size varies with the organism group and crop studied, and is greater in landscapes with higher land-use intensity. Decisions about where to site organic farms to maximize biodiversity will, however, depend on the costs as well as the potential benefits. Current studies have been heavily biased towards agricultural systems in the developed world. We recommend that future studies pay greater attention to other regions, in particular, areas with tropical, subtropical and Mediterranean climates, in which very few studies have been conducted. © 2013 The Authors.

	abstract = {Certification within organic agriculture exhibits flexibility with respect to practices used to demonstrate that a product meets published quality standards. This case study of Mexican certified-organic agriculture finds two forms. Indigenous smallholders of southern Mexico undertake a low-input, process-oriented organic farming in which certification is based upon extensive document review, group inspections, and assessment of on-farm capacity to produce organic inputs. More recently, northern Mexican large agribusiness producers have implemented certifications based upon laboratory testing and assessment of purchased inputs. To specify these differences, this article examines large and small producers in Mexico's organic agriculture sector based on a diagnostic census of Mexican organic agriculture in 668 production zones and field surveys in 256 production zones in which 28 indicators were analyzed. After comparing the organic cultivation and certification practices of large, agro-industrial, input-oriented private firms versus small, cooperatively organized, indigenous and peasant groups, we analyze the implications of this duality for certification frameworks. We argue (with Raynolds, L., 2004. The globalization of organic agro-food networks. World Development 32(5), 725-743; Gonzalez A.A., and Nigh, R., 2005.

	abstract = {Numerous reports have emphasized the need for major changes in the global food system: agriculture must meet the twin challenge of feeding a growing population, with rising demand for meat and high-calorie diets, while simultaneously minimizing its global environmental impacts. Organic farminga system aimed at producing food with minimal harm to ecosystems, animals or humans-is often proposed as a solution. However, critics argue that organic agriculture may have lower yields and would therefore need more land to produce the same amount of food as conventional farms, resulting in more widespread deforestation and biodiversity loss, and thus undermining the environmental benefits of organic practices. Here we use a comprehensive meta-analysis to examine the relative yield performance of organic and conventional farming systems globally. Our analysis of available data shows that, overall, organic yields are typically lower than conventional yields. But these yield differences are highly contextual, depending on system and site characteristics, and range from 5\% lower organic yields (rain-fed legumes and perennials on weak-acidic to weak-alkaline soils), 13\% lower yields (when best organic practices are used), to 34\% lower yields (when the conventional and organic systems are most comparable). Under certain conditions-that is, with good management practices, particular crop types and growing conditions-organic systems can thus nearly match conventional yields, whereas under others it at present cannot. To establish organic agriculture as an important tool in sustainable food production, the factors limiting organic yields need to be more fully understood, alongside assessments of the many social, environmental and economic benefits of organic farming systems. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

We draw theoretical and analytical guidance from the identity-protective cognition thesis explaining the white male effect and from recent political psychology scholarship documenting the heightened system-justification tendencies of political conservatives. We utilize public opinion data from ten Gallup surveys from 2001 to 2010, focusing specifically on five indicators of climate change denial. We find that conservative white males are significantly more likely than are other Americans to endorse denialist views on all five items, and that these differences are even greater for those conservative white males who self-report understanding global warming very well. Furthermore, the results of our multivariate logistic regression models reveal that the conservative white male effect remains significant when controlling for the direct effects of political ideology, race, and gender as well as the effects of nine control variables. We thus conclude that the unique views of conservative white males contribute significantly to the high level of climate change denial in the United States. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

In a randomized experimental design with over 100,000 households, we study the longer-term impacts of a one-time behavioral nudge that aimed to induce voluntary reductions in water use during a drought. Combining technical information, moral suasion, and social comparisons, the nudge has a surprisingly persistent effect. Although its effect size declines by almost 50\% after 1 year, it remains detectable and policy-relevant six years later. In fact, the total reduction in water use achieved after the 4-month period targeted by the intervention is larger than the total reduction achieved during the target period. Further analysis suggests that the intervention works through both short-lived behavioral adjustments and longer-lived adjustments to habits or physical capital. Treatment effects are not detectable in homes from which the treated consumers have moved, which provides suggestive evidence that these longer-lived adjustments are mobile rather than incorporated into the housing stock. The persistence of the effect makes the intervention more cost-effective than previously assumed (cost drops by almost 60\%). Nevertheless, water utilities may find this persistence undesirable if the nudges are intended to have only a short-run effect on demand during environmental emergencies.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Global climate change is experienced very differently across race, gender, class and nationality. Wealthy people in the Global North who generate the most carbon emissions have been apathetic regarding climate change, considering it a low priority in relation to other social problems. Meanwhile climate impacts are felt most acutely by women of color in the Global South. In today's globalized risk society such perceptions of near and far, immediate or abstract are politically charged social constructions. How do privileged people with knowledge of climate science re-create a sense of safety in the face of troubling events and information? What is the significance of their constructions of risk and concern in reproducing transnational power relations along the lines of race, gender and class? This paper is part of a larger project that uses ethnographic observation and interviews in a rural Norwegian community I call 'Bygdaby' to understand why globally privileged people perceive climate change as relatively unimportant. Here data are re- analyzed with emphasis on the relationship between the cultural production of denial and the maintenance of global privilege. I describe how for people in Bygdaby knowledge of climate change threatened a sense of order and innocence. People were aware of climate change but simultaneously re-created a sense that "everything was fine." Normalization of climate change occurred by using "tools of order" to recreate order and security and "tools of innocence" for the "construction of innocence." In the course of normalizing a troubling situation, residents simultaneously reproduce transnational environmental privilege. The construction of denial and innocence work to silence the needs and voices of women and people of color in the Global South, and thus reproduce global inequality along the lines of gender, race and class.

	abstract = {At first glance, the compatibility of social theory and resilience thinking is not entirely evident, in part because the ontology of the former is rooted in social interactions among human beings rather than ecological process. Despite this difference, resilience thinking engages with particular aspects of social organization that have generated intense debates within social science, namely the role of humans as integral elements of social-ecological systems and the processes through which given social structures (including material relations) are either maintained or transformed. Among social theoretical approaches, Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is noted for its distinctive approach to these aspects. ANT proposes that human and nonhuman components (both referred to as actants) have the same capacity to influence the development of social-ecological systems (represented as actor-networks) by enacting relations and enrolling other actors. We explore the notion of agency that is employed in resilience thinking and ANT in order to extend our understandings of human-environment relationships through complementary insights from each approach. The discussion is illustrated by reference to ongoing assessment of resilience as it is experienced and expressed in two distinctive agricultural production systems: Indonesian rice and New Zealand kiwifruit. We conclude by establishing the potential for ANT to provide more profound theoretical conceptualizations of agency, both human and nonhuman, in analyses of social ecological systems.},

	abstract = {A social-ecological system (SES) framework increasingly underpins the " resilience paradigm. " As with all models, the SES comes with particular biases. We explore these key biases. We critically examine how the SES resilience literature has attempted to define and analyze the social arena. We argue that much SES literature defines people's interests and livelihoods as concerned primarily with the environment, and thereby underplays the role of other motivations and social institutions. We also highlight the SES resilience literature's focus on institutions and organized social units, which misses key aspects of social diversity and power. Our key premise is the importance of inter-and multi-disciplinary perspectives. To illustrate this, we draw attention to the critique of earlier ecological anthropology that remains relevant for current conceptualizations of SESs, focusing on the concepts of social diversity and power. And we discuss insights from social anthropology and political ecology that have responded to this critique to develop different ways of incorporating social diversity and power into human-environment relations. Finally, we discuss how these social science perspectives can help improve the understanding of the " social " in SES resilience research.},

To explain this, we first scrutinize the meanings, attributes, and uses of resilience in ecology and elsewhere to construct a typology of definitions. Second, we analyze core concepts and principles in resilience theory that cause disciplinary tensions between the social and natural sciences (system ontology, system boundary, equilibria and thresholds, feedback mechanisms, self-organization, and function). Third, we provide empirical evidence of the asymmetry in the use of resilience theory in ecology and environmental sciences compared to five relevant social science disciplines. Fourth, we contrast the unification ambition in resilience theory with methodological pluralism. Throughout, we develop the argument that incommensurability and unification constrain the interdisciplinary dialogue, whereas pluralism drawing on core social scientific concepts would better facilitate integrated sustainability research.},

	abstract = {The concept of resilience has evolved considerably since Holling's (1973) seminal paper. Different interpretations of what is meant by resilience, however, cause confusion. Resilience of a system needs to be considered in terms of the attributes that govern the system's dynamics. Three related attributes of social-ecological systems (SESs) determine their future trajectories: resilience, adaptability, and transformability. Resilience (the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks) has four components - latitude, resistance, precariousness, and panarchy - most readily portrayed using the metaphor of a stability landscape. Adaptability is the capacity of actors in the system to influence resilience (in a SES, essentially to manage it). There are four general ways in which this can be done, corresponding to the four aspects of resilience. Transformability is the capacity to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic, or social structures make the existing system untenable. The implications of this interpretation of SES dynamics for sustainability science include changing the focus from seeking optimal states and the determinants of maximum sustainable yield (the MSY paradigm), to resilience analysis, adaptive resource management, and adaptive governance.

The evidence reveals that the likelihood of regime shifts may increase when humans reduce resilience by such actions as removing response diversity, removing whole functional groups of species, or removing whole trophic levels; impacting on ecosystems via emissions of waste and pollutants and climate change; and altering the magnitude, frequency, and duration of disturbance regimes. The combined and often synergistic effects of those pressures can make ecosystems more vulnerable to changes that previously could be absorbed. As a consequence, ecosystems may suddenly shift from desired to less desired states in their capacity to generate ecosystem services. Active adaptive management and governance of resilience will be required to sustain desired ecosystem states and transform degraded ecosystems into fundamentally new and more desirable configurations.},

The review concentrates on experiences of adaptive governance of social-ecological systems during periods of abrupt change (crisis) and investigates social sources of renewal and reorganization. Such governance connects individuals, organizations, agencies, and institutions at multiple organizational levels. Key persons provide leadership, trust, vision, meaning, and they help transform management organizations toward a learning environment. Adaptive governance systems often self-organize as social networks with teams and actor groups that draw on various knowledge systems and experiences for the development of a common understanding and policies. The emergence of ?bridging organizations? seem to lower the costs of collaboration and conflict resolution, and enabling legislation and governmental policies can support self-organization while framing creativity for adaptive comanagement efforts.

	abstract = {Recent work in ecology suggests that the diversity of responses to environmental change among species contributing to the same ecosystem function can strongly influence ecosystem resilience. To render this important realization more useful for understanding coupled human-natural systems, we broaden the concept of response diversity to include heterogeneity in human decisions and action. Simply put, not all actors respond the same way to challenges, opportunities, and risks. The range, prevalence, and spatial and temporal distributions of different responses may be crucial to the resilience or the transformation of a social-ecological system and thus have a bearing on human vulnerability and well-being in the face of environmental, socioeconomic, and political change. Response diversity can be seen at multiple scales (e.g., household, village, region), and response diversity at one scale may act synergistically with or contrary to the effects of diversity at another scale. Although considerable research on the sources of response diversity has been done, our argument is that the consequences of response diversity warrant closer attention. We illustrate this argument with examples drawn from our studies of two East African pastoral populations and discuss the relationship of response diversity to characteristics of social-ecological systems that can promote or diminish resilience. © 2013 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

In combination with technical advances in agriculture, dietary change is suggested to be necessary to reduce the environmental impact of the food system.

The aims are to i) evaluate the scientific basis of dietary scenario analysis, ii) estimate the potential environmental effects of dietary change, iii) identify methodological aspects of importance for outcome and iv) identify current gaps in knowledge. The review includes 14 peer-reviewed journal articles assessing the GHG emissions and land use demand of in total 49 dietary scenarios. The results suggest that dietary change, in areas with affluent diet, could play an important role in reaching environmental goals, with up to 50\% potential to reduce GHG emissions and land use demand associated with the current diet. The choice of functional unit, system boundaries and methods for scenario development and accounting for uncertainties are methodological aspects identified to have major influence on the quality and results of dietary scenario analysis. Further understanding of dietary change as a measure for more sustainable food systems requires improved knowledge of uncertainty in dietary scenario studies, environmental impact from substitutes and complements to meat and the effect of dietary change in different groups of populations and geographical locations.},

	abstract = {Food systems (FS) encompass the entire range of actors and their interlinked value-adding activities involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption and disposal of food products that originate from agriculture, forestry or fisheries, and parts of the broader economic, societal and natural environments in which they are embedded. The food system is composed of subsystems (e.g. farming system, waste management system, input supply system, etc.) and interacts with other key systems (e.g. energy system, trade system, health system, etc.). Therefore, a structural change in the food system might originate from a change in another system; for example, a policy promoting more biofuel in the energy system will have a significant impact on the food system. A sustainable food system (SFS) is a food system that delivers food security and nutrition for all in such a way that the economic, social and environmental bases to generate food security and nutrition for future generations are not compromised. This means that:-It is profitable throughout (economic sustainability);-It has broad-based benefits for society (social sustainability); and-It has a positive or neutral impact on the natural environment (environmental sustainability). A sustainable food system lies at the heart of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adopted in 2015, the SDGs call for major transformations in agriculture and food systems in order to end hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition by 2030. To realize the SDGs, the global food system needs to be reshaped to be more productive, more inclusive of poor and marginalized populations, environmentally sustainable and resilient, and able to deliver healthy and nutritious diets to all. These are complex and systemic challenges that require the combination of interconnected actions at the local, national, regional and global levels. A food system must be considered in the context of rapid population growth, urbanization, growing wealth, changing consumption patterns, and globalization as well as climate change and the depletion of natural resources. The developments in food systems have yielded many positive results, especially over the past three decades in developing countries. These results include the expansion of off-farm employment opportunities as food industries have developed, and the widening of food choices beyond local staples, thus satisfying consumers' preferences in terms of taste, form and quality.},

The systems representing the three resources are intrinsically connected and, as such, there is a need to develop assessment tools that consider their interdependences. Specifically when evaluating the environmental performance of a food production system, it is necessary to understand its life cycle. The objective of this paper is to introduce an integrated energy, water and food life cycle assessment tool that integrates EWF resources in one robust model and at an appropriate resolution. The nexus modelling tool developed is capable of providing an environmental assessment for food production systems utilising a holistic systems approach as described by a series of subsystems that constitute each of the EWF resources. A case study set in Qatar and characterised by an agriculture sub-system, which includes the production and application of fertilisers and the raising of livestock, a water sub-system represented by mechanical and thermal desalination processes and an energy sub-system, which includes fossil fuel in the form of combined cycle natural gas based energy production and solar renewable energy is used to illustrate the model function. For the nexus system analysed it is demonstrated that the food system is the largest contributor to global warming. The GWP can be reduced by up to 30\% through the utilisation of solar energy to substitute fossil fuels, which, however, comes with a significant requirement for land investment.},

A consistent finding is that, across different types of inputs, men generally have higher input measures than women, and that this input gap is responsible for observed productivity differences between men and women; however, this finding is often sensitive to the use of models that control for other background factors, as well as the type of gender indicator implemented in the analysis. The final section presents future directions, opportunities, and recommendations for microeconomic gender analysis of nonland agricultural inputs.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This article introduces the special issue “LCA of nutrition and food consumption” and 14 papers selected from the Ninth LCA Food Conference in San Francisco in October 2014. Literature overview: The scientific literature in the field of food LCA has increased more than ten times during the last 15 years. Nutrition has a high contribution to the total environmental impacts of consumption. Agricultural production often dominates the impacts, but its importance depends on the type of product, its production mode, transport, and processing. Local or domestic products reduce transports, but this advantage can be lost if the impacts of the raw material production are substantially increased. Diets containing less meat tend to be more environmentally friendly. Several studies concluded that respecting the dietary recommendations for a healthy diet would reduce the overall environmental impacts in the developed countries, although this is not a universal conclusion. Contribution of this special issue: Eight papers analyze the environmental impacts of catering and in-house food consumption and impacts on sectoral and national levels; four papers presents tools and methods to better assess the impacts of nutrition and to implement the results in practical decision-making. Finally, two contributions analyze the impacts of food waste and reduction options. Challenges for the environmental assessment of nutrition: (i) Comprehensive assessment. Most studies only analyze climate impacts, although data, methods, and tools are readily available for a more comprehensive analysis. (ii) Assessment of sustainability. The social dimension remains the weakest pillar. (iii) Data availability is still an obstacle, but significant progress has been made in recent years. (iv) Lack of harmonization of methodologies makes comparisons among studies difficult. (v) Land use. Enhanced consideration of land use impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services is required in LCA. (vi) Defining the functional unit including nutritional aspects, food security, and health needs further work. (vii) Consumer behavior. Its impacts are still little assessed. (viii) Communication of the environmental impact assessment results to stakeholders including policy-makers and consumers needs additional efforts. Research needs and outlook: (i) Development of holistic approaches for the assessment of sustainable food systems, (ii) assessment of land use related impacts and inclusion of ecosystem services, (iii) exploration of LCA results for policy support and decision-making, (iv) investigation of food consumption patterns in developing and emerging countries, and (v) harmonization of databases.},

We find that both groups engage in precarious work, with consequences for their health and safety, including immigrant workers with citizenship. Nevertheless, migrant guest workers are subject to more coercive forms of labor discipline and a narrower range of social protection than immigrants. We argue that while formal citizenship can mitigate some dimensions of precariousness for farmworkers racialized as non-white, achieving a more just, safer food system will require broader policies to improve employer compliance and address legislative shortcomings that only weakly protect agricultural labor. © 2014, by the Rural Sociological Society.},

	abstract = {RESUMEN En la actualidad, diversos factores de carácter ambiental, social, económico, cultural y político, han motivado el interés por el desarrollo de la agricultura orgánica, reconociéndose como una alternativa económicamente eficiente, socialmente justa y ecológicamente sostenible con potencial para atenuar los impactos negativos atribuidos a la agricultura convencional. Pese a su dinamismo, el cual se refleja en tasas de crecimiento superiores a 25\%, la estadística oficial no registra de manera adecuada su evolución, se atribuye en parte que éste sector quede excluido del ejercicio de la actual política agrícola nacional. Por lo tanto, la actualización permanente de los datos estadísticos se convierte en una necesidad para poder definir políticas para su fomento. En ese sentido, el artículo presenta y analiza los datos levantados entre 2007 y 2008 dentro del proyecto "sistema de seguimiento e información de la agricultura orgánica de México", que los autores iniciaron en 1995; se resalta la geografía de la producción, la diversificación de la producción, el perfil de los productores, la participación de la población indígena, el papel de la mujer, así como la problemática que impide potenciar sus impactos y las oportunidades, entre otros aspectos. Palabras clave: alternativa, agricultura orgánica, desarrollo, diversificación, geografía de la producción. ABSTRACT At the present time, diverse factors of environmental, social, economic, cultural and political character, have motivated the interest for development of organic agriculture, recognizing as an economically efficient, socially responsible and ecologically sustainable alternative, with potential to attenuate negative impacts attributed to conventional agriculture. In spite its dynamism, which reflected growth rates superior to 25\%, there are no official records to supervise its evolution, then this sector is excluded from current national agricultural policies. Therefore, the permanent update of statistical data becomes a need to define policies that favor its development. In that sense, the article presents and analyzes data gathered between 2007 and 2008 inside the project "tracking and information system of organic agriculture in Mexico" that the authors began in 1995; the production geography, the production diversification, the producers profile, the indigenous population participation, the women paper are analyzed as well as problem that stops potentiate its impact and opportunities, between other aspects. INTRODUCCIÓN La agricultura orgánica ha adquirido importancia dentro del sistema agroalimentario en más de 154 países; existen alrededor de 67 millones de hectáreas certificadas en forma orgánica, por lo menos 560 000 unidades de producción atendidas por 1.4 millones de productores (Willer y Kilcher, 2010). A pesar de la aceptación y extensión que ha alcanzado esta forma de producir y la filosofía que la sustenta, no ha terminado la discusión sobre su denominación y definición. De acuerdo con Baillieux y Scharpe (1994), la variabilidad de la terminología para la denominación como agricultura orgánica, biológica, ecológica o biodinámica se debe principalmente a razones lingüísticas. Así como existe variabilidad de la terminología para su denominación, existen también varias definiciones que son objeto de debate, según el foro de discusión donde se trate: Organización de las Naciones Unidas para la Agricultura y la Alimentación y la Organización Mundial de la Salud (FAO-WHO), Unión Europea (UE), Estados Unidos de América y la Federación Internacional de Movimientos de la Agricultura Orgánica (IFOAM), por sus siglas en inglés. No obstante, tales definiciones coinciden en que es un método que consiste en la gestión del ecosistema en vez de la utilización de insumos de síntesis química. Es decir, la agricultura orgánica es concebida como un sistema holístico de gestión de la producción que fomenta y mejora la salud de los agroecosistemas, y en particular la biodiversidad, los ciclos y la actividad biológica del suelo, a través de prácticas que excluyen el uso de productos de síntesis química. Para este artículo, se adopta la definición de la IFOAM aprobada en su congreso mundial en 2008: "la agricultura orgánica es un sistema de producción que mantiene y mejora la salud de los suelos, los ecosistemas y las personas. Se basa fundamentalmente en los procesos ecológicos, la biodiversidad y los ciclos adaptados a las condiciones locales, sin usar insumos que tengan efectos adversos. La agricultura orgánica combina tradición, innovación y ciencia para favorecer el medio ambiente que compartimos y promover relaciones justas y una buena calidad de vida para todos los que participan en ella" (IFOAM, 2008).},

Today's LCA users are a mixture of individuals with skills in different disciplines who want to evaluate their products, processes, or activities in a life cycle context. This study attempts to present some of the LCA studies on agricultural and industrial food products, recent advances in LCA and their application on food products. The reviewed literatures indicate that agricultural production is the hotspot in the life cycle of food products and LCA can assist to identify more sustainable options. Due to the recent development of LCA methodologies and dissemination programs by international and local bodies, use of LCA is rapidly increasing in agricultural and industrial food products. A network of information sharing and exchange of experience has expedited the LCA development process. The literatures also suggest that LCA coupled with other approaches provides much more reliable and comprehensive information to environmentally conscious policy makers, producers, and consumers in selecting sustainable products and production processes. Although LCA methodologies have been improved, further international standardization would broaden its practical applications, improve the food security and reduce human health risk. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The human health and environmental issues related to food, feed, and bio-based systems, range widely from greenhouse gas emissions and energy use to land use, water availability, soil quality, water quality and quantity, biodiversity losses, and chemical exposure. Threats that stem from other issues, including food quality and food security, the development of genetically modified organisms, desertification, pesticide exposure, antibiotic-resistant strains of microorganisms, growth hormone residues in food, etc.; are of concern. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology provides the organizing framework to holistically evaluate the environmental impacts of products and production systems, whether it's to make a durable, disposable or edible good. The use of LCA in environmental management and sustainability has grown rapidly in recent years as demonstrated by the increasing number of published papers on LCA methodology and case studies, which totaled over 4,500 by 2010. Recognizing the need to focus on the impacts of the agri-food industry, this special issue was developed by selecting sixteen papers from the 85 presented at the Bari LCA Food 2010 conference, and publishing them with eight papers submitted as part of the normal flow to the Journal of Cleaner Production on food-related subjects. The papers in this special issue include case studies from LCAs on relevant dimensions of production of a wide array of types of food, discussions on methodological issues, especially water and land use, the application of product certification schemes, and food preservation. The editors of this special issue acknowledge that progress has been made in strengthening the LCA tools but challenge all LCA practitioners and researchers to push the envelope on LCA methodology and encourage them to develop tools that dynamically address the diverse, rapidly evolving issues related to agricultural products that are not currently addressed. It is hoped the challenges that are outlined in this Special Issue will stimulate many to make progress on improving the food LCA tools prior to the next food LCA conference in this series, which will be held in Saint-Malo, France, on 2-4 October 2012.

	abstract = {Goal, Scope and Background. Food production systems invariably precipitate negative environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment (LCA), a standardised tool for evaluating the environmental costs of manufactured goods, is currently being expanded to address diverse product groups and production processes. Among these is food production, where the technosphere is tightly interlinked with the biosphere. The goal of this paper is to contribute to exploring the suitable functional units, system boundaries and allocation procedures for LCA in food production in general, and the product category rules (PCR) and environmental product declaration (EPD) for food products in specific. Main Features. A review of published scientific articles and conference papers treating LCA of food products is used to highlight and discuss different ways of defining the goal and scope of the LCA of food products, with an emphasis on defining the functional unit, setting the system boundaries and choosing a co-product allocation method. Results. Different ways of choosing the production system and system boundaries, functional unit and co-product allocation procedure are shown and discussed. The most commonly used functional unit is based on mass, but there are more sophisticated ways of expressing the functional unit for food products, like protein and energy content. A quality corrected functional unit (QCFU) is proposed. Discussion. Choice of the functional unit is highly dependent on the aim of the study. Mass or volume may be more relevant, as a basis for the functional unit, than land use. However, other qualities of the food product like nutrient content, like energy content, fat content, protein content or a combination thereof, would be a more sophisticated functional unit for food products. Conclusions and Recommendations. While LCA methodology is a valuable tool in conducting environmental impact assessments of food products, further methodological development to account for food-specific functions, like nutrient content, is needed. To facilitate a valid comparison between different products, system boundary description and functional units need further development and standardisation. A more sophisticated choice of a functional unit, taking nutreint content of the food into consideration in addition to mass, could both reflect the function of the food better and provide a solution to the coproduct allocation problem that exists for some food products. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {Life cycle thinking is increasingly seen as a key concept for ensuring a transition towards more sustainable production and consumption patterns. As food production systems and consumption patterns are among the leading drivers of impacts on the environment, it is important to assess and improve food-related supply chains as much as possible. Over the years, life cycle assessment has been used extensively to assess agricultural systems and food processing and manufacturing activities, and compare alternatives “from field to fork” and through to food waste management. Notwithstanding the efforts, several methodological aspects of life cycle assessment still need further improvement in order to ensure adequate and robust support for decision making in both business and policy development contexts. This paper discusses the challenges for life cycle assessment arising from the complexity of food systems, and recommends research priorities for both scientific development and improvements in practical implementation. In summary, the intrinsic variability of food production systems requires dedicated modelling approaches, including addressing issues related to: the distinction between technosphere and ecosphere; the most appropriate functional unit; the multi-functionality of biological systems; and the modelling of the emissions and how this links with life cycle impact assessment. Also, data availability and interpretation of the results are two issues requiring further attention, including how to account for consumer behaviour.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between the development of the dominant industrial food system and its associated global economic drivers and the environmental sustainability of agricultural landscapes. It makes the case that the growth of the global industrial food system has encouraged increasingly complex forms of “distance” that separate food both geographically and mentally from the landscapes on which it was produced. This separation between food and its originating landscape poses challenges for the ability of more localized agricultural sustainability initiatives to address some of the broader problems in the global food system. In particular, distance enables certain powerful actors to externalize ecological and social costs, which in turn makes it difficult to link specific global actors to particular biophysical and social impacts felt on local agricultural landscapes. Feedback mechanisms that normally would provide pressure for improved agricultural sustainability are weak because there is a lack of clarity regarding responsibility for outcomes. The paper provides a brief illustration of these dynamics with a closer look at increased financialization in the food system. It shows that new forms of distancing are encouraged by the growing significance of financial markets in global agrifood value chains. This dynamic has a substantial impact on food system outcomes and ultimately complicates efforts to scale up small-scale local agricultural models that are more sustainable.},

Presenting findings from empirical work with smallholder producers, we discuss the impact of men's migration to the United States on women's participation in agriculture and gendered relations of agricultural production. In 2007, we conducted a survey of 155 semi-subsistence, smallholder households in six ejidos. This survey was supplemented by ethnographic research in a single ejido. Our findings demonstrate the need to distinguish between farm labour and management in this sector, and the potentially significant (but focused) changes in the local relations of agricultural production wrought by gendered patterns of labour migration - specifically in tenure, land-use decision-making and the management of hired labour. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

This work applies techno-ecological synergy concepts in an optimization formulation to design a system for co-producing food and energy under constraints on ecological sustainability. The system includes land use activities and biomass conversion processes for the production of energy carriers, as well as supporting ecosystems that increase the supply of key ecosystem services. The co-production system was linearized and reduced to a mixed-integer linear program, which was optimized for single objectives under a variety of production and sustainability constraints. Results indicate that for the system considered to achieve high food and energy co-production, land use options should be balanced between food-producing crops and electricity-producing wind turbines and solar panels. Results also show that ecological sustainability can be achieved for this system with relatively small changes in land use patterns. The inclusion of nature in the design enables the system as a whole to achieve ecological sustainability for multiple ecosystem services with moderate sacrifices of food and energy productivity.},

Although much progress has been made in the provision of individual component of FEW, it remains unknown whether there is an optimized strategy to balance the FEW nexus as a whole, reduce air and water pollution, and mitigate climate change on national and global scales. Increasing FEW conflicts in the agroecosystems make it an urgent need to improve our understanding and quantification of how to balance resource investment and enhance resource use efficiencies in the FEW nexus. Therefore, we propose an integrated modeling system of the FEW nexus by coupling an ecosystem model, an economic model, and a regional climate model, aiming to mimic the interactions and feedbacks within the ecosystem–human–climate systems. The trade-offs between FEW benefit and economic cost in excess resource usage, environmental degradation, and climate consequences will be quantitatively assessed, which will serve as sustainability indicators for agricultural systems (including crop production, livestock and aquaculture). We anticipate that the development and implementation of such an integrated modeling platform across world's regions could build capabilities in understanding the agriculture-centered FEW nexus and guiding policy and land management decision making for a sustainable future.},

This paper provides a comprehensive literature review to debate the current concepts and methods of the FEW nexus at different scales, with the aim of developing a conceptual knowledgebase framework for scientific analysis and policy making associated with the urban FEW nexus. Although the concept of nexus thinking has been widely accepted, a consistent and explicit cognition of the FEW nexus is still lacking, and a sophisticated methodological modeling framework is urgently required at various scales. As such, we proposed a three-dimensional conceptual framework of the urban FEW nexus from the perspective of resource interdependency, resource provision and system integration. This framework is useful in steering the systematic modeling and integrative management of the complex nexus issues of urban systems with different perspectives. Finally, the future directions of urban nexus research are identified from four aspects, including systematic characterization, cross-region tele-connection mechanisms, co-decision model development, and governance transition.},

	abstract = {Introduction Today we are more than ever convinced that security in food, energy and water is interwoven with human, economic and environmental sustainability, and that this inter-play is strengthening under growing natural resource scarcity and climate change. This recognition suggests that policy making and decision making for sustainability could benefit from a holistic nexus approach that reduces trade-offs and builds synergies across sectors, and thus helps reduce costs and increase benefits for humans and nature, as compared to independent approaches to the management of water, energy and food, without compromising the resource basis on which humanity relies. In the past, research and policy work related to the nexus has looked at the interactions between water and food or water and energy, but given political and institutional realities there has been a reluctance to bring forward a broader systemic perspective to capture the dependencies across multiple sectors and resources. At the same time, the cost to the environment of neglecting these linkages has increased. The players in the nexus approach are public, private and civil society at local and broader human scales. Recognizing the urgent need to focus on sustainability in the water–energy–food nexus (WEF nexus) together with tools to analyze and approaches to govern the linkages at different scales, the Global Water System Project, the United Nations Environment Programme, the Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik, the Center for Development Research (ZEF), University of Bonn, and the CGIAR Research Program on Water Land and Ecosystems organized an international conference, Sustainability in the Water-Energy-Food Nexus, in Bonn, Germany, in 2014. The conference addressed sustainability in the WEF nexus as a key research-for-action initiative, and included an international policy consultation process to inform, influence and catalyze action of policy makers, nongovernmental organizations, the private sector, educators and researchers towards a nexus approach that both draws on and supports the environment. The conference brought together available information, identified knowledge and action gaps, shared lessons on viable instruments and approaches, facilitated networks, and contributed to consensus on priorities for appropriate investment and action by different actors and stakeholders for moving towards action on the WEF nexus. This special issue is an outcome of that conference, and contains significant pieces of work on the WEF nexus that were presented at the conference focusing on relevant tools, solutions and governance at different scales.

Biophysical scientists in particular struggle with how to integrate "gendered" water uses into models that are necessarily based on prevailing laws and equations that describe the movement of water through the hydrological cycle, independent of social constructs. We explore the challenges faced in developing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research approaches and then present a simple yet innovative socio-hydrological approach using participatory three-dimensional maps. As a case study, we describe undertaking this process in Ethiopia where two three-dimensional maps (men's and women's) were separately generated to represent the same 20km$^{\textrm{2}}$ landscape. Mapping results indicated important distinctions in how men and women view landscapes with regard to the number and types of ecosystem services identified. For example, only women identified holy water sites along streams, while men identified twice as many sacred trees on the landscape. There was a clear focus and detailed knowledge about soils among participants in both groups. Maps developed as part of this exercise were successfully used as the principal land use input for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and results indicate that this is a valid strategy that enhances scientific knowledge and understanding of overall landscapes and ultimately adds value to research for development questions.},

The author outlines the need for further research to deepen the understanding of why women must be involved in policy decisions that affect agriculture and food security. The basis for this paper is rooted in the following observations:rules for agriculture are changingwomen’s long-standing traditional roles in agriculture have been largely ignored, especially by economistswomen are not affected the same way as men by the changes in agriculturebecause of women’s different traditional roles, impacts on their livelihoods need to be understoodgender-blind policy making has deepened some of the traditional inequities as well as created some new onesThe author uses a number of case studies of women in agriculture in developing countries to examine how they are affected by trade and investment policy changes and pointing to the importance of a gender analysis. The case studies look at rice, corn, cashews, cut flowers, and poultry.The author concludes that women, because of their particular roles in agriculture, are disproportionately affected by changes in agriculture, and at the same time are disproportionately absent from policy discussions. It is argued that research has not kept pace with the recent sweeping changes in trade and agriculture, and how they pertain to gender inequity. Finally, the author argues that ensuring that gender is a core component of alternative policymaking while taking into account the many layers of research that need consideration will lead towards the realization of food sovereignty and the right to food.},

Although yield increases have predominantly contributed to increased crop production over the recent decades, increased cropping area as well as increases in cropping intensity, especially in the tropics, have played a substantial role. Therefore, we need to consider these important aspects of production to get a more complete understanding of the future impacts of climate change. This article reviews available evidence on how climate might inﬂuence these under-studied components of crop production.

	abstract = {Predicting the potential effects of climate change on crop yields requires a model of how crops respond to weather. As predictions from different models often disagree, understanding the sources of this divergence is central to building a more robust picture of climate change’s likely impacts. A common approach is to use statistical models trained on historical yields and some simpliﬁed measurements of weather, such as growing season average temperature and precipitation. Although the general strengths and weaknesses of statistical models are widely understood, there has been little systematic evaluation of their performance relative to other methods. Here we use a perfect model approach to examine the ability of statistical models to predict yield responses to changes in mean temperature and precipitation, as simulated by a process-based crop model. The CERES-Maize model was ﬁrst used to simulate historical maize yield variability at nearly 200 sites in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as the impacts of hypothetical future scenarios of 2 ◦C warming and 20\% precipitation reduction. Statistical models of three types (time series, panel, and cross-sectional models) were then trained on the simulated historical variability and used to predict the responses to the future climate changes. The agreement between the process-based and statistical models’ predictions was then assessed as a measure of how well statistical models can capture crop responses to warming or precipitation changes. The performance of statistical models differed by climate variable and spatial scale, with time-series statistical models ably reproducing site-speciﬁc yield response to precipitation change, but performing less well for temperature responses. In contrast, statistical models that relied on information from multiple sites, namely panel and cross-sectional models, were better at predicting responses to temperature change than precipitation change. The models based on multiple sites were also much less sensitive to the length of historical period used for training. For all three statistical approaches, the performance improved when individual sites were ﬁrst aggregated to country-level averages. Results suggest that statistical models, as compared to CERES-Maize, represent a useful if imperfect tool for projecting future yield responses, with their usefulness higher at broader spatial scales. It is also at these broader scales that climate projections are most available and reliable, and therefore statistical models are likely to continue to play an important role in anticipating future impacts of climate change.},

After statistical post-model calibration, the process model (Simple Simulation Model, or SSM) predicts actual outcomes slightly better than the statistical model, but the combined model performs signiﬁcantly better than either model. The SSM, statistical model and combined model all show similar relationships with precipitation, while the SSM better accounts for temporal patterns of precipitation, vapor pressure deﬁcit and solar radiation. The statistical and combined models show a more negative impact associated with extreme heat for which the process model does not account. Due to the extreme heat effect, predicted impacts under uniform climate change scenarios are considerably more severe for the statistical and combined models than for the process-based model.},

These crops comprise two of the four largest sources of caloric energy produced and are thus critical for world food supply. We pair a panel of county-level yields for these two crops, plus cotton (a warmer-weather crop), with a new fine-scale weather dataset that incorporates the whole distribution of temperatures within each day and across all days in the growing season. We find that yields increase with temperature up to 29° C for corn, 30° C for soybeans, and 32° C for cotton but that temperatures above these thresholds are very harmful. The slope of the decline above the optimum is significantly steeper than the incline below it. The same nonlinear and asymmetric relationship is found when we isolate either time-series or cross-sectional variations in temperatures and yields. This suggests limited historical adaptation of seed varieties or management practices to warmer temperatures because the cross-section includes farmers' adaptations to warmer climates and the time-series does not. Holding current growing regions fixed, area-weighted average yields are predicted to decrease by 30–46\% before the end of the century under the slowest (B1) warming scenario and decrease by 63–82\% under the most rapid warming scenario (A1FI) under the Hadley III model.},

However, given that adaptive measures are limited, it is possible that climate change will affect food availability and increase price volatility. This essay presents a synthesis of the evidence of the effects that climate change has on the agricultural sector, with a special emphasis on Latin America. This revision makes it clear that the effects are going to be heterogeneous and that they could very well be costly. Therefore, public policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time promoting adaptive measures to climate change, are essential. The essay concludes with some considerations on future research topics that could contribute to the design of said public policies.},

The analysis uses economic data from 2,431 municipalities for the period 2003 to 2009. The study distinguishes between irrigated, rainfed and mixed farms and includes extreme weather events as an additional variable. The results indicate that irrigated farms are more vulnerable to temperature variations, while rainfed farms are more vulnerable to precipitation changes and extreme weather events. The projected impact in net revenue per hectare, considering a temperature rise of 2.5\&deg;C and a 10\% reduction in precipitation, are between -18.6 and -36.4\% of net revenue considering all type of farms. This climate scenario predicts average losses of net revenue ranging from, 26 to 55\%; 14 to 25\% and 27 to 37\% for irrigated, rainfed and mixed municipalities, respectively.

These combined market failures provide a strong rationale for a portfolio of public policies that foster emissions reduction as well as the development and adoption of environmentally beneficial technology. Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that the rate and direction of technological advance is influenced by market and regulatory incentives, and can be cost-effectively harnessed through the use of economic-incentive based policy. In the presence of weak or nonexistent environmental policies, investments in the development and diffusion of new environmentally beneficial technologies are very likely to be less than would be socially desirable. Positive knowledge and adoption spillovers and information problems can further weaken innovation incentives. While environmental technology policy is fraught with difficulties, a long-term view suggests a strategy of experimenting with policy approaches and systematically evaluating their success.},

Using Isabelle Stengers’ critique of 21st-century science, I argue for a slowing down in Physical Geography, by changing how we relate to the subjects that we study. I use the ideas of William Bunge to discuss the notion of geographical expedition as a means of achieving slow science, even if “expedition” is a term to be used cautiously. I illustrate these points from one of my own projects to show how slow science may allow creation of those moments that might lead to a more creative and critical Physical Geography centred on the very curiosity that makes being a scientist so interesting.},

Reﬂecting upon this Special Issue as an experiment in disciplinary discourse, we argue for collective attention towards disciplinary reproduction. While an intellectual case can continue to be made for the utility of physical geography for understanding planetary problems, if we do not produce new physical geographers who identify as geographers and who reinvest into geographical institutions, then physical geography as an intellectual tradition will cease to exist. Rather than being passive recipients of change in the geosciences, we can utilize disciplinary forums to critically examine our scientiﬁc priorities and build necessary alliances to affect the direction of these changes.},

I first explore common features of the intellectual histories of resilience thinking and political ecology. Despite parallel and common influences and reactions, the two fields diverge significantly along two dimensions: in their normative commitments and adherence to systems thinking. Given these divergences, I argue that intellectual engagement between these fields will prove to be most productive if circumscribed around land-use ecology – an area of inquiry important to both fields.},

	abstract = {Perennial crops are among the most valuable of California’s diverse agricultural products. They are also potentially the most influenced by information on future climate, since individual plants are commonly grown for more than 30 years. This study evaluated the impacts of future climate changes on the 20 most valuable perennial crops in California, using a combination of statistical crop models and downscaled climate model projections. County records on crop harvests and weather from 1980 to 2005 were used to evaluate the influence of weather on yields, with a series of cross-validation and sensitivity tests used to evaluate the robustness of perceived effects. In the end, only four models appear to have a clear weather response based on historical data, with another four presenting significant but less robust relationships. Projecting impacts of climate trends to 2050 using historical relationships reveals that cherries are the only crop unambiguously threatened by warming, with no crops clearly benefiting from warming. Another robust result is that almond yields will be harmed by winter warming, although this effect may be counteracted by beneficial warming in spring and summer. Overall, the study has advanced understanding of climate impacts on California agriculture and has highlighted the importance of measuring and tracking uncertainties due to the difficulty of uncovering crop-climate relationships.},

	abstract = {Most research on the agricultural impacts of climate change has focused on the major annual crops, yet perennial cropping systems are less adaptable and thus potentially more susceptible to damage. In regions where perennial crops are economically and culturally important, improved assessments of yield responses to future climate are needed to prioritize adaptation strategies. These impact assessments, in turn, must rely on climate and crop models that contain often poorly defined uncertainties. We evaluated the impact of climate change on six major perennial crops in California: wine grapes, almonds, table grapes, oranges, walnuts, and avocados. Outputs from multiple climate models were used to evaluate climate uncertainty, while multiple statistical crop models, derived by resampling historical databases, were used to address crop response uncertainties. We find that, despite these uncertainties, climate change in California is very likely to put downward pressure on yields of almonds, walnuts, avocados, and table grapes by 2050. Without CO2 fertilization or adaptation measures, projected losses range from 0 to {\textgreater}40\% depending on the crop and the trajectory of climate change. Climate change uncertainty generally had a larger impact on projections than crop model uncertainty, although the latter was substantial for several crops. Opportunities for expansion into cooler regions were identified, but this adaptation would require substantial investments and may be limited by non-climatic constraints. Given the long time scales for growth and production of orchards and vineyards (∼30 years), climate change should be an important factor in selecting perennial varieties and deciding whether and where perennials should be planted.},

Given the importance of collisions as an anthropogenic threat to birds, mitigation is essential. Patterned glass and UV-reflective films have been proven to prevent collisions. At Duke University’s West campus in Durham, North Carolina, we set out to identify the buildings and building characteristics associated with the highest frequencies of collisions in order to propose a mitigation strategy. We surveyed six buildings, stratified by size, and measured architectural characteristics and surrounding area variables. During 21 consecutive days in spring and fall 2014, and spring 2015, we conducted carcass surveys to document collisions. In addition, we also collected ad hoc collision data year-round and recorded the data using the app iNaturalist. Consistent with previous studies, we found a positive relationship between glass area and collisions. Fitzpatrick, the building with the most window area, caused the most collisions. Schwartz and the Perk, the two small buildings with small window areas, had the lowest collision frequencies. Penn, the only building with bird deterrent pattern, caused just two collisions, despite being almost completely made out of glass. Unlike many research projects, our data collection led to mitigation action. A resolution supported by the student government, including news stories in the local media, resulted in the application of a bird deterrent film to the building with the most collisions: Fitzpatrick. We present our collision data and mitigation result to inspire other researchers and organizations to prevent bird-window collisions.},

	abstract = {Millions of birds die in bird-window collisions in the United States each year. In specialized test settings, researchers have developed methods to alter window designs to mitigate collisions. However, few published studies provide pretest and posttest evaluations of mitigation treatment areas and untreated control areas on existing buildings. We initially monitored bird-window collisions at a single building on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA, during winter 1 (November 9, 2017-January 2, 2018). We found 15 bird-window collisions, most under a portion of the building with a mirrored façade. To test a mitigation treatment, we installed Feather Friendly® bird deterrent film on part of the mirrored façade after winter 1. The unmitigated areas of the same building served as a control area. We continued monitoring during the following winter 2 (November 15, 2018-January 12, 2019). The treated area collisions declined from seven before mitigation to two after mitigation, a 71\% reduction. The control area had eight collisions at both times. Results of a generalized estimating equation yielded a significant area by season interaction effect (p = 0.03) and fewer collisions in the mitigated area than the control area at winter 2 (p = 0.03), supporting efficacy of the mitigation. In winter 2 we also expanded monitoring to eight total buildings to evaluate the risks of mirrored windows and proximity to fruiting pear trees (Prunus calleryana) and the benefits of bird-friendly glass. Bird-friendly glass, found on two buildings, included windows with permanent fritted dots or embedded ultraviolet patterns. We counted 22 collisions across the eight buildings. Mirrored windows and proximity to fruiting pear trees related to higher odds of bird-window collisions, based on separate generalized estimating equations. The best fit model included mirrored windows and pear trees. The two buildings with bird-friendly glass had only one collision, suggesting that these designs deter collisions, although the difference was not statistically significant. To publicize the study and to receive reports of additional bird collisions or fatalities on campus, we created a citizen science project on iNaturalist and engaged in additional outreach efforts that yielded 22 ad hoc reports. Many previous studies have documented Cedar Waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum) collisions, but at relatively low numbers. Cedar Waxwings accounted for 31 of 34 identifiable collisions from the monitoring study and 4 of 21 identifiable collisions or fatalities from ad hoc reports.},

	abstract = {Sustainable production systems have always relied on the flexibility, efficiency, and multiple functions of perennial trees and forages grown in combination with annual cereals, legumes, and oil species. But over the last 50 years, research, technologies and markets have
focused mainly on a limited number of annual species to meet the increased demand for food. Furthermore, the primary focus was on increasing grain yields with reduced attention given to
the social, environmental and market consequences of these food systems.
However, food security and agriculture are now entering an era characterized by scarce and depleted resources, climate change, price volatility and job losses. To adapt to this new era, agricultural technologies, science and markets have to be transformed to ensure sufficient food
is produced for a growing population, while meeting simultaneously the economic, social and environmental challenges of twenty first century.},

Unprecedented agricultural land expansions since 1700, and technological innovations that began in the 1930s, have enabled more calorie production per capita than was ever available before in history. This remarkable success, however, has come at a great cost. Agriculture is a major cause of global environmental degradation. Malnutrition persists among large sections of the population, and a new epidemic of obesity is on the rise. We review both the successes and failures of the global food system, addressing ongoing debates on pathways to environmental health and food security. To deal with these challenges, a new coordinated research program blending modern breeding with agro-ecological methods is needed. We call on plant biologists to lead this effort and help steer humanity toward a safe operating space for agriculture.},

	abstract = {Vulnerability to climate change was evaluated for three different time periods: 1990, 2000, and 2010. Our objective was to discuss the scope of a multi-temporal assessment of vulnerability. The method used 55 indicators—with emphasis on the agricultural sector in Mexico—of which 27 were updated for the year 2010 and 33 were retrospectively estimated for the year 1990. The results show that in the 20-year study period, the exposure of the municipalities (and inhabitants) has increased, and sensitivity and adaptive capacity have decreased. The number of municipalities vulnerable to climate change declined over the 20year period. We found that calculating vulnerability by adding exposure and sensitivity and subtracting adaptive capacity (E + S − AC) can lead to unintentional underestimation of total vulnerability. When rating vulnerability, care must be taken in what is reported: the results differ for the number of inhabitants versus the number of municipalities. Our previous published vulnerability evaluation was for the year 2000, so we wanted to evaluate the sensitivity of some variables and the vulnerability formula itself we used in that moment. It is possible to evaluate the vulnerability multi-temporally, which allows to evaluate the sensibility and calibration of the variables and indicators used and the reconsideration of their application.},

	abstract = {In this study, yields of rainfed maize, beans, wheat, soybeans, sorghum, barley and potatoes were modeled under current conditions and under 28 scenarios of climate change. The methodology considered calibration of the FAO Aquacrop crop model for 24 specific case studies located in 14 states of Mexico. The climate scenarios considered were five models (CNRM, GFDL, HADGEM, MPI and Ensemble REA), two concentrations of radiative forcing (4.5 and 8.5 W*m-2) and three time horizons (2015-2039, 2045-2069 and 2075-2099). The results show decreases in yields for most of the case studies as a consequence of a decrease in amount and distribution of precipitation. Maize yield in hot dry climates could decrease up to 84\% in the most severe scenarios, relative to the base scenario. Beans could have decreases of 10\% and 40\% in the northern part of the country, while in the northwest a 15\% decrease in wheat yield is predicted. Soybeans could benefit, with increases of 15 to 40\%. Sorghum and potatoes are expected to decrease in general for all the case studies, while barley would have increases and decreases, depending on the study area. The results urge taking action aimed toward differentiated adaptation for specific crops and regions. Thus, rainfed agriculture in Mexico is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.},

	abstract = {This review argues that nutrition is an integral component of food security, and should be embedded within all four of its dimensions – availability, access, utilization, and stability. The review highlights current food insecurity in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, as exacerbated by the triple burden of malnutrition, where undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight/obesity coexist. Previous efforts to address food security in MENA have focused on food availability, overlooking the other three dimensions and leaving nutrition considerations aside. Meanwhile, the literature has recognized the need to highlight nutrition as fundamental, and opted for the term ‘food and nutrition security’. To achieve food and nutrition security in MENA, a nutrition lens must be applied across all four dimensions – from assessment, to policy and programming, to capacity building. For example, MENA countries can adopt policies and programs including well-structured food subsidies, dietary guidelines, public awareness, and education campaigns to increase availability and accessibility of nutritious and safe foods, and stimulate consumer demand for those. To accomplish this, MENA needs to build stakeholders' capacity and equip them to address the challenges that are hindering the achievement of food and nutrition security now and into the future.},

Although much research has focused on questions of food security, less has been devoted to assessing the wider health impacts of future changes in agricultural production. In this modelling study, we estimate excess mortality attributable to agriculturally mediated changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors by cause of death for 155 world regions in the year 2050.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}For this modelling study, we linked a detailed agricultural modelling framework, the International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT), to a comparative risk assessment of changes in fruit and vegetable consumption, red meat consumption, and bodyweight for deaths from coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and an aggregate of other causes. We calculated the change in the number of deaths attributable to climate-related changes in weight and diets for the combination of four emissions pathways (a high emissions pathway, two medium emissions pathways, and a low emissions pathway) and three socioeconomic pathways (sustainable development, middle of the road, and more fragmented development), which each included six scenarios with variable climatic inputs.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Findings{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The model projects that by 2050, climate change will lead to per-person reductions of 3·2\% (SD 0·4\%) in global food availability, 4·0\% (0·7\%) in fruit and vegetable consumption, and 0·7\% (0·1\%) in red meat consumption. These changes will be associated with 529 000 climate-related deaths worldwide (95\% CI 314 000–736 000), representing a 28\% (95\% CI 26–33) reduction in the number of deaths that would be avoided because of changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors between 2010 and 2050. Twice as many climate-related deaths were associated with reductions in fruit and vegetable consumption than with climate-related increases in the prevalence of underweight, and most climate-related deaths were projected to occur in south and east Asia. Adoption of climate-stabilisation pathways would reduce the number of climate-related deaths by 29–71\%, depending on their stringency.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Interpretation{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The health effects of climate change from changes in dietary and weight-related risk factors could be substantial, and exceed other climate-related health impacts that have been estimated.

	abstract = {Climate change is predicted to have major impacts on small-scale farmers in Mexico whose livelihoods depend on rain-fed maize. We examined the capacity of traditional maize seed systems to provide these farmers with appropriate genetic material under predicted agro-ecological conditions associated with climate change. We studied the structure and spatial scope of seed systems of 20 communities in four transects across an altitudinal gradient from 10–2,980 m above sea level in five states of eastern Mexico. Results indicate that 90\% of all of the seed lots are obtained within 10 km of a community and 87\% within an altitudinal range of ±50 m but with variation across four agro-climate environments: wet lowland, dry lowland, wet upper midlatitude, and highlands. Climate models suggest a drying and warming trend for the entire study area during the main maize season, leading to substantial shifts in the spatial distribution patterns of agro-climate environments. For all communities except those in the highlands, predicted future maize environments already are represented within the 10-km radial zones, indicating that in the future farmers will have easy access to adapted planting material. Farmers in the highlands are the most vulnerable and probably will need to acquire seed from outside their traditional geographical ranges. This change in seed sources probably will entail important information costs and the development of new seed and associated social networks, including improved linkages between traditional and formal seed systems and more effective and efficient seed-supply chains. The study has implications for analogous areas elsewhere in Mexico and around the world.},

We analyze the energy balances and greenhouse gas emissions from export-oriented avocado orchards in Mexico. Avocado is a very important export crop and one of the main drivers of land-use change in the country. We compared 12 avocado orchards under organic and conventional management during two production cycles (2010 and 2011) in a representative region of Central Mexico. Our analysis shows no significant differences in energy consumption and GHG emissions between organic and conventional systems with 55 and 56GJha−1, and 3.30tCO2equiv.ha−1 and 3.57tCO2equiv.ha−1, respectively. Organic systems show three times more use of renewable energy than their conventional counterparts. However both systems depend heavily on fossil fuel inputs, machinery and N-fertilizers (synthetic or organic). Also, there is a high heterogeneity in management practices and input application within both systems, which is reflected in a large variation of their energy-related parameters. Given that avocado production is rapidly expanding in Mexico, a move toward organic production without systematically changing toward less fossil fuel dependent agricultural practices would not be sufficient to ensure a sustainable production.},

Of the avocados (Persea americana Mill), Hass is the most commonly cultivated variety in the world, representing an important source of nutrition in numerous countries, yet its potential risks in the face of climate change are unknown. Here, we characterise current and future potential distributional areas for Hass avocado under different scenarios of climate change across the Americas. We use ecological-niche modelling approaches to explore implications of changes in climate, considering 22 general circulation models, two emissions scenarios, and six model parameterisations. The current potential distribution of Hass avocado extends across tropical America (excluding most of Amazonia), including some areas at higher latitudes. Future projections show stability in potential distribution. Range expansions are expected mainly in temperate areas, and range contractions are related to temperature and precipitation increases, mostly in Amazonia. Model parametrisations contributed the most to overall variation in future projections, followed by climate models, and then emissions scenarios. Our conclusion of relative stability for the crop’s potential distribution is still subject to effects on other components of avocado production systems, and may be vulnerable to extreme phenomena.},

To aid understand- ing of how tmin and tmax differentially affect crop yields, we ana- lyzed variations of regional spring wheat yields and temperatures for three irrigated sites in western North America that were charac- terized by low correlations between tmin and tmax. The crop model CERES-Wheat v3.5 was evaluated in each site and used to project future response to temperature changes. Tmin and tmax exhibited distinct historical correlations with yields, with CERES successfully capturing the observed relationships in each region. In the Yaqui Valley of Mexico, historical yields were strongly correlated with tmin but not tmax. However, CERES projections of response to increased tmin or tmax (holding other variables constant) were similar ({\textbar}6\% C21), indicating that the apparent historical importance of tmin mainly results from covariation between temperatures and solar radia- tion and not greater direct effects of tmin on yields. In the San Luis- Mexicali Valley of Mexico and in the Imperial Valley of California, the opposite was observed: historical yield correlations with tmin and tmax were similar, but projected responses to tmax were roughly three times larger than tmin. The latter is explained by opposing effects of tmin and tmax on grain filling rates in CERES, with higher tmin increasing harvest indices. This model mechanism was not clearly supported by historical data and remains an area of uncertainty for projecting yield responses to climate change.},

	abstract = {Increasing global food demand, low grain reserves and climate change threaten the stability of food systems on national to global scales1–5. Policies to increase yields, irrigation and tolerance of crops to drought have been proposed as stability-enhancing solutions1,6,7. Here we evaluate a complementary possibility—that greater diversity of crops at the national level may increase the year-to-year stability of the total national harvest of all crops combined. We test this crop diversity–stability hypothesis using 5 decades of data on annual yields of 176 crop species in 91 nations. We find that greater effective diversity of crops at the national level is associated with increased temporal stability of total national harvest. Crop diversity has stabilizing effects that are similar in magnitude to the observed destabilizing effects of variability in precipitation. This greater stability reflects markedly lower frequencies of years with sharp harvest losses. Diversity effects remained robust after statistically controlling for irrigation, fertilization, precipitation, temperature and other variables, and are consistent with the variance-scaling characteristics of individual crops required by theory8,9 for diversity to lead to stability. Ensuring stable food supplies is a challenge that will probably require multiple solutions. Our results suggest that increasing national effective crop diversity may be an additional way to address this challenge.},

However, there are no global analyses that have quantitatively assessed if global crop production has actually tended towards synchronized failure historically. We show that synchronization in production within major commodities such as maize and soybean has declined in recent decades, leading to increased global stability in production of these crops. In contrast, synchrony between crops has peaked, making global calorie production more unstable. Under the hypothetical event of complete synchronized failure we estimate simultaneous global production losses for rice, wheat, soybean and maize to lie between −17\% and −34\%. We find that offsetting these losses by reducing variation in production across all growing locations, and raising production ceilings in breadbaskets, are far more effective than strategies focused on reducing variability in breadbaskets alone or closing production gaps in low productive locations. Our findings suggest that maintaining asynchrony in the food system requires a central place in discussions of future food demand under mean climate change, population growth and consumption trends.},

Unprecedented agricultural land expansions since 1700, and technological innovations that began in the 1930s, have enabled more calorie production per capita than was ever available before in history. This remarkable success, however, has come at a great cost. Agriculture is a major cause of global environmental degradation. Malnutrition persists among large sections of the population, and a new epidemic of obesity is on the rise. We review both the successes and failures of the global food system, addressing ongoing debates on pathways to environmental health and food security. To deal with these challenges, a new coordinated research program blending modern breeding with agro-ecological methods is needed. We call on plant biologists to lead this effort and help steer humanity toward a safe operating space for agriculture.},

In this paper, our objective was to identify the climate signal in the realized yields of maize, sorghum, and groundnut in SSA. We explored the relation between crop yields and scale-compatible climate data for the 1962–2014 period using Random Forest, a diagnostic machine learning technique. We found that improved agricultural technology and country fixed effects are three times more important than climate variables for explaining changes in crop yields in SSA. We also found that increasing temperatures reduced yields for all three crops in the temperature range observed in SSA, while precipitation increased yields up to a level roughly matching crop evapotranspiration. Crop yields exhibited both linear and nonlinear responses to temperature and precipitation, respectively. For maize, technology steadily increased yields by about 1\% (13 kg/ha) per year while increasing temperatures decreased yields by 0.8\% (10 kg/ha) per °C. This study demonstrates that although we should expect increases in future crop yields due to improving technology, the potential yields could be progressively reduced due to warmer and drier climates.},

	abstract = {Accurate predictions of crop yield are critical for developing effective agricultural and food policies at the regional and global scales. We evaluated a machine-learning method, Random Forests (RF), for its ability to predict crop yield responses to climate and biophysical variables at global and regional scales in wheat, maize, and potato in comparison with multiple linear regressions (MLR) serving as a benchmark. We used crop yield data from various sources and regions for model training and testing: 1) gridded global wheat grain yield, 2) maize grain yield from US counties over thirty years, and 3) potato tuber and maize silage yield from the northeastern seaboard region. RF was found highly capable of predicting crop yields and outperformed MLR benchmarks in all performance statistics that were compared. For example, the root mean square errors (RMSE) ranged between 6 and 14\% of the average observed yield with RF models in all test cases whereas these values ranged from 14\% to 49\% for MLR models. Our results show that RF is an effective and versatile machine-learning method for crop yield predictions at regional and global scales for its high accuracy and precision, ease of use, and utility in data analysis. RF may result in a loss of accuracy when predicting the extreme ends or responses beyond the boundaries of the training data.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear regression models are important tools because many crop and soil processes are better represented by nonlinear than linear models. Fitting nonlinear models is not a single-step procedure but an involved process that requires careful examination of each individual step. Depending on the objective and the application domain, different priorities are set when fitting nonlinear models; these include obtaining acceptable parameter estimates and a good model fit while meeting standard assumptions of statistical models. We propose steps in fitting nonlinear models as described by a flow diagram and discuss each step separately providing examples and updates on procedures used. The following steps are considered: (i) choose candidate models, (ii) set starting values, (iii) fit models, (iv) check convergence and parameter estimates, (v) find the “best” model among competing models, (vi) check model assumptions (residual analysis), and (vii) calculate statistical descriptors and confidence intervals. The associated feedback mechanisms are also addressed (i.e., model variance homogeneity). In particular, we emphasize the first step (choose candidate models) by providing an extensive library of nonlinear functions (77 equations with the associated parameter meanings) and examples of typical applications in agriculture. We hope that this contribution will clarify some of the difficulties and confusion with the task of using nonlinear models.},

However, very few studies had been conducted to review systematically the previous statistical models for indentifying climate contributions to crop yields. This paper introduces three main statistical methods, i.e., time-series model, cross-section model and panel model, which have been used to identify such issues in the field of agrometeorology. Generally, research spatial scale could be categorized into two types using statistical models, including site scale and regional scale (e.g. global scale, national scale, provincial scale and county scale). Four issues exist in identifying response sensitivity of crop yields to climate change by statistical models. The issues include the extent of spatial and temporal scale, non-climatic trend removal, colinearity existing in climate variables and non-consideration of adaptations. Respective resolutions for the above four issues have been put forward in the section of perspective on the future of statistical models finally.},

We describe an approach to yield modeling that uses a semiparametric variant of a deep neural network, which can simultaneously account for complex nonlinear relationships in high-dimensional datasets, as well as known parametric structure and unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity. Using data on corn yield from the US Midwest, we show that this approach outperforms both classical statistical methods and fully-nonparametric neural networks in predicting yields of years withheld during model training. Using scenarios from a suite of climate models, we show large negative impacts of climate change on corn yield, but less severe than impacts projected using classical statistical methods. In particular, our approach is less pessimistic in the warmest regions and the warmest scenarios.},

	abstract = {Climate change could potentially interrupt progress toward a world without hunger. A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a “climate-smart food system” that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security.},

Estimating the model across 949 farmers in seven countries, we find that both temperature and precipitation affect the crops that South American farmers choose. Farmers choose fruits and vegetables in warmer locations and wheat and potatoes in cooler locations. Farms in wetter locations are more likely to grow rice, fruits, potatoes, and squash and in dryer locations maize and wheat. Global warming will cause South American farmers to switch away from maize, wheat, and potatoes towards squash, fruits and vegetables. Predictions of the impact of climate change on net revenue must reflect not only changes in yields per crop but also crop switching.},

	abstract = {\#1 New York Times Bestseller from the author of How to Change Your Mind, The Omnivore's Dilemma, and Food Rules  Food. There's plenty of it around, and we all love to eat it. So why should anyone need to defend it? Because in the so-called Western diet, food has been replaced by nutrients, and common sense by confusion--most of what we’re consuming today is longer the product of nature but of food science. The result is what Michael Pollan calls the American Paradox: The more we worry about nutrition, the less healthy we see to become. With In Defense of Food, Pollan proposes a new (and very old) answer to the question of what we should eat that comes down to seven simple but liberating words: "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." Pollan’s bracing and eloquent manifesto shows us how we can start making thoughtful food choices that will enrich our lives, enlarge our sense of what it means to be healthy, and bring pleasure back to eating. "Michael Pollan [is the] designated repository for the nation's food conscience."—Frank Bruni, The New York Times " A remarkable volume . . . engrossing . . . [Pollan] offers those prescriptions Americans so desperately crave."—The Washington Post "A tough, witty, cogent rebuttal to the proposition that food can be redced to its nutritional components without the loss of something essential... [a] lively, invaluable book."—Janet Maslin, The New York Times "In Defense of Food is written with Pollan's customary bite, ringing clarity and brilliance at connecting the dots."—The Seattle TimesMichael Pollan’s most recent food book Cooked: A Natural History of Transformation--the story of our most trusted food expert’s culinary education--was published by Penguin Press in April 2013, and in 2016 it served as the inspiration for a four-part docuseries on Netflix by the same name. Pollan is also the author of How to Change Your Mind: What the New Science of Psychedelics Teaches Us About Consciousness, Dying, Addiction, Depression, and Transcendence},

Although there is a long history of public engagement in agriculture and food science, the term ‘citizen science’ has rarely been applied to these efforts. Similarly, in the emerging field of citizen science, most new citizen science projects do not focus on food or agriculture. Here, we convened thought leaders from a broad range of fields related to citizen science, agriculture, and food science to highlight key opportunities for bridging these overlapping yet disconnected communities/fields and identify ways to leverage their respective strengths. Specifically, we show that (i) citizen science projects are addressing many grand challenges facing our food systems, as outlined by the United States National Institute of Food and Agriculture, as well as broader Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations Development Programme, (ii) there exist emerging opportunities and unique challenges for citizen science in agriculture/food research, and (iii) the greatest opportunities for the development of citizen science projects in agriculture and food science will be gained by using the existing infrastructure and tools of Extension programmes and through the engagement of urban communities. Further, we argue there is no better time to foster greater collaboration between these fields given the trend of shrinking Extension programmes, the increasing need to apply innovative solutions to address rising demands on agricultural systems, and the exponential growth of the field of citizen science.},

It has been hypothesized these mixtures produce more biomass, suppress more weeds, scavenge more N, conserve more soil water, stimulate more soil biology, promote higher yields of subsequent crops, and have higher production stability than the best of their monoculture counterparts. This systematic review synthesizes a growing body of cover crop mixture research to assess, for these metrics, whether cover crop mixtures can perform better than their constituent species when planted alone. Searching three databases, we identified 27 studies which compared cover crop mixtures (containing at least three species) to all their constituent species. The studies contained 119 sampled cover crop plantings that met our eligibility criteria. From these, we extracted 243 full comparisons of the best-performing mixture and best-performing monoculture for the selected metrics. In 88\% of these comparisons, the monoculture and mixture performed comparably. In 10\% of the comparisons, the monoculture did better, and in 2\% of comparisons the mixture performed better. Overall, there are few published studies documenting the superiority of cover crop mixtures over monocultures for our selected metrics.},

are available to the wide majority of data analysts are limited with regard to handling incomplete panel data. We review various

of existing procedures can be overcome. In a simulation study based on real panel data, we illustrate these procedures’ quality

	abstract = {This study empirically identifies the impact of global-warming-induced climate change on Japan’s agricultural production using panel data. First, we constructed panel data; combining time-series data from 1995 to 2006 for a cross-section of eight regions in Japan. Next, we conducted a static panel data analysis, using a function for agricultural products incorporating labor and three weather variables (temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation.) From the estimation results of the production function, we selected the production function with the aforementioned labor and weather variables and found that the rising temperatures and precipitation and falling solar radiation caused by climate change have reduced the rice production, while rising temperatures and precipitation have reduced the vegetable and potato production in Japan. Second, we conducted dynamic panel data analysis, using a production function for agricultural products incorporating labor, a one-period lagged output, and the same three weather variables. Based on the estimation results of the dynamic panel data model, we selected the production function for agricultural products using only the labor and three weather variables and found the same results for both the rice production and vegetable and potato production in Japan. Based on the estimated results of the static and dynamic-panel data models for variable mean annual temperature, which serves as a proxy for climate change, we concluded that an increase of 1°C in mean annual temperature would reduce rice production by 5.8\% in the short term and 3.9\% in the long term, and vegetables and potatoes productions by 5.0\% and 8.6\% in the short term and long term, respectively.},

	abstract = {In this research, the fixed effect panel data predictive model was employed to formulate panel regression models of food production of 15 selected Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) using four (4) World Development Indicators (WDI) as explanatory variables. Data were collected from 1990 to 2013. The four WDI are Food imports (\% of merchandise imports), Agricultural land (\% of land area), Fertilizer consumption (kilograms per hectare of arable land) and Inflation (consumer prices annual \%). The fixed effect with cross-sectional seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) static panel data method was employed. The result of the analysis shows that agricultural land and fertilizer consumption have significant positive effect on the food production index of ECOWAS countries, while food imports and rate of inflation have significant negative effect on food production index of the ECOWAS countries. It is seen that 98.8\% of the variation in food production among ECOWAS countries can be explained by the variations in food imports, agricultural land, fertilizer consumption and inflation. We therefore recommend that ECOWAS countries should increase agricultural land and fertilizer consumption and reduce food imports and rate of inflation in order to boost their food production level and have excess to export.},

	abstract = {Understanding the impact of changes in temperature and precipitation on crop yields is a vital step in developing policy and management options to feed the world. As most existing studies are limited to a few staple crops, we implemented global statistical models to examine the influence of weather and management practices on the yields of 18 crops, accounting for 70\% of crop production by area and 65\% by calorific intake. Focusing on the impact of temperature, we found considerable heterogeneity in the responses of yields across crops and countries. Irrigation was found to alleviate negative implications from temperature increases. Countries where increasing temperature causes the most negative impacts are typically the most food insecure, with the lowest calorific food supply and average crop yield. International action must be coordinated to raise yields in these countries through improvement and modernization of agricultural practices to counteract future adverse impacts of climate change.},

This study aims at assessing the effectiveness of food labelling in increasing the selection of healthier products and in reducing calorie intake. In addition, this study compares the relative effectiveness of trafﬁc light schemes, Guideline Daily Amount and other food labelling schemes. A comprehensive set of databases were searched to identify randomized studies. Studies reporting homogeneous outcomes were pooled together and analysed through meta-analyses. Publication bias was evaluated with a funnel plot. Food labelling would increase the amount of people selecting a healthier food product by about 17.95\% (conﬁdence interval: +11.24\% to +24.66\%). Food labelling would also decrease calorie intake/choice by about 3.59\% (conﬁdence interval: À8.90\% to +1.72\%), but results are not statistically signiﬁcant. Trafﬁc light schemes are marginally more effective in increasing the selection of healthier options. Other food labels and Guideline Daily Amount follow. The available evidence did not allow studying the effects of single labelling schemes on calorie intake/choice. Findings of this study suggest that nutrition labelling may be an effective approach to empowering consumers in choosing healthier products. Interpretive labels, as trafﬁc light labels, may be more effective.},

	abstract = {Pre-harvest yield estimation of mango fruit is important for the optimization of inputs and other resources on the farm. Current industry practice of visual counting the fruit on a small number of trees for yield forecasting can be highly inaccurate due to the spatial variability, especially if the trees selected do not represent the entire crop. Therefore, this study evaluated the potential of high resolution WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite imagery to estimate yield of mango by integrating both geometric (tree crown area) and optical (spectral vegetation indices) data using artificial neural network (ANN) model. WV3 images were acquired in 2016\&ndash;2017 and 2017\&ndash;2018 growing seasons at the early fruit stage from three orchards in Acacia Hills region, Northern Territory, Australia. Stratified sampling technique (SST) was applied to select 18 trees from each orchard and subsequently ground truthed for yield (kg\&middot;tree\&minus;1) and fruit number per tree. For each sampled tree, spectral reflectance data and tree crown area (TCA) was extracted from WV3 imagery. The TCA was identified as the most important predictor of both fruit yield (kg\&middot;tree\&minus;1) and fruit number, followed by NDVI red-edge band when all trees from three orchards in two growing seasons were combined. The results of all sampled trees from three orchards in two growing seasons using ANN model produced a strong correlation (R2 = 0.70 and 0.68 for total fruit yield (kg\&middot;tree\&minus;1) and fruit number respectively), which suggest that the model can be obtained to predict yield on a regional level. On orchard level also the ANN model produced a high correlation when both growing seasons were combined. However, the model developed in one season could not be applied in another season due to the influence of seasonal variation and canopy condition. Using the relationship derived from the measured yield parameters against combined VIs and TCA data, the total fruit yield (t\&middot;ha\&minus;1) and fruit number were estimated for each orchard, produced 7\% under estimation to less than 1\% over estimation. The accuracy of the findings showed the potential of WV3 imagery to better predict the yield parameters than the current practice across the mango industry as well as to quantify lost yield as a result of delayed harvest.},

	abstract = {Most research on the agricultural impacts of climate change has focused on the major annual crops, yet perennial cropping systems are less adaptable and thus potentially more susceptible to damage. In regions where perennial crops are economically and culturally important, improved assessments of yield responses to future climate are needed to prioritize adaptation strategies. These impact assessments, in turn, must rely on climate and crop models that contain often poorly defined uncertainties. We evaluated the impact of climate change on six major perennial crops in California: wine grapes, almonds, table grapes, oranges, walnuts, and avocados. Outputs from multiple climate models were used to evaluate climate uncertainty, while multiple statistical crop models, derived by resampling historical databases, were used to address crop response uncertainties. We find that, despite these uncertainties, climate change in California is very likely to put downward pressure on yields of almonds, walnuts, avocados, and table grapes by 2050. Without CO2 fertilization or adaptation measures, projected losses range from 0 to {\textgreater}40\% depending on the crop and the trajectory of climate change. Climate change uncertainty generally had a larger impact on projections than crop model uncertainty, although the latter was substantial for several crops. Opportunities for expansion into cooler regions were identified, but this adaptation would require substantial investments and may be limited by non-climatic constraints. Given the long time scales for growth and production of orchards and vineyards (∼30 years), climate change should be an important factor in selecting perennial varieties and deciding whether and where perennials should be planted.},

	isbn = {978-1-60358-571-2},
	shorttitle = {The {Carbon} {Farming} {Solution}},
	abstract = {With carbon farming, agriculture ceases to be part of the climate problem and becomes a critical part of the solution Agriculture is rightly blamed as a major culprit of our climate crisis. But in this groundbreaking new book, Eric Toensmeier argues that agriculture--specifically, the subset of practices known as "carbon farming"--can, and should be, a linchpin of a global climate solutions platform.   Carbon farming is a suite of agricultural practices and crops that sequester carbon in the soil and in above-ground biomass. Combined with a massive reduction in fossil fuel emissions--and in concert with adaptation strategies to our changing environment-- carbon farming has the potential to bring us back from the brink of disaster and return our atmosphere to the "magic number" of 350 parts per million of carbon dioxide. Toensmeier''s book is the first to bring together these powerful strategies in one place, including in-depth analysis of the available research and, where research is lacking, a discussion of what it will take to get us there.  Carbon farming can take many forms. The simplest practices involve modifications to annual crop production. Although many of these modifications have relatively low sequestration potential, they are widely applicable and easily adopted, and thus have excellent potential to mitigate climate change if practiced on a global scale. Likewise, grazing systems such as silvopasture are easily replicable, don''t require significant changes to human diet, and--given the amount of agricultural land worldwide that is devoted to pasture--can be important strategies in the carbon farming arsenal. But by far, agroforestry practices and perennial crops present the best opportunities for sequestration. While many of these systems are challenging to establish and manage, and would require us to change our diets to new and largely unfamiliar perennial crops, they also offer huge potential that has been almost entirely ignored by climate crusaders.   Many of these carbon farming practices are already implemented globally on a scale of millions of hectares. These are not minor or marginal efforts, but win-win solutions that provide food, fodder, and feedstocks while fostering community self-reliance, creating jobs, protecting biodiversity, and repairing degraded land--all while sequestering carbon, reducing emissions, and ultimately contributing to a climate that will remain amenable to human civilization. Just as importantly to a livable future, these crops and practices can contribute to broader social goals such as women''s empowerment, food sovereignty, and climate justice.   The Carbon Farming Solution does not present a prescription for how cropland should be used and is not, first and foremost, a how-to manual, although following up on references in a given section will frequently provide such information. Instead, The Carbon Farming Solution is--at its root--a toolkit. It is the most complete collection of climate-friendly crops and practices currently available. With this toolkit, farmers, communities, and governments large and small, can successfully launch carbon farming projects with the most appropriate crops and practices to their climate, locale, and socioeconomic needs.   Toensmeier''s ultimate goal is to place carbon farming firmly in the center of the climate solutions platform, alongside clean solar and wind energy. With The Carbon Farming Solution, Toensmeier wants to change the discussion, impact policy decisions, and steer mitigation funds to the research, projects, and people around the world who envision a future where agriculture becomes the protagonist in this fraught, urgent, and unprecedented drama of our time. Citizens, farmers, and funders will be inspired to use the tools presented in this important new book to transform degraded lands around the world into productive carbon-storing landscapes.},

The model accounts for the main processes of fruit growth, i.e., leaf photosynthesis, fruit demand, fruit respiration, and storage and mobilization of leaf and stem reserves. Simulations for three successive years and for various leaf-to-fruit ratio treatments showed good agreement with observed fruit growth data. Simulations of fruit growth under different climatic conditions, especially with contrasting temperature and radiation, and for different values of initial fruit dry mass and leaf-to-fruit ratio, showed that variations in fruit growth among years can be partly explained by climatic variations through their effects on leaf photosynthesis, fruit demand and fruit growth rate. However, climatic changes contribute substantially less to observed variability in fruit growth than to initial fruit dry mass and leaf-to-fruit ratio.},

The Vibrio cholerae strains were resistant to tetracycline and doxycycline, the commonly used drugs for cholera treatment. Despite the efforts of international organisations, which provided medical relief by establishing treatment centres in Goma, mortality from the disease was much higher than expected. In the area of Muganga camp, which had the largest concentration of refugees and where most of the medical aid organisations were active, the highest reported case-fatality ratio for a single day was 48\%. The slow rate of rehydration, inadequate use of oral rehydration therapy, use of inappropriate intravenous fluids, and inadequate experience of health workers in management of severe cholera are thought to be some of the factors associated with the failure to prevent so many deaths during the epidemic. In one of the temporary treatment centres with the worst case-fatality record, our team showed that improvement of these factors could increase the odds of survival of cholera patients even in a disaster setting.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the global burden of cholera using population-based incidence data and reports. METHODS: Countries with a recent history of cholera were classified as endemic or non-endemic, depending on whether they had reported cholera cases in at least three of the five most recent years. The percentages of the population in each country that lacked access to improved sanitation were used to compute the populations at risk for cholera, and incidence rates from published studies were applied to groups of countries to estimate the annual number of cholera cases in endemic countries. The estimates of cholera cases in non-endemic countries were based on the average numbers of cases reported from 2000 to 2008. Literature-based estimates of cholera case-fatality rates (CFRs) were used to compute the variance-weighted average cholera CFRs for estimating the number of cholera deaths. FINDINGS: About 1.4 billion people are at risk for cholera in endemic countries. An estimated 2.8 million cholera cases occur annually in such countries (uncertainty range: 1.4-4.3) and an estimated 87 000 cholera cases occur in non-endemic countries. The incidence is estimated to be greatest in children less than 5 years of age. Every year about 91 000 people (uncertainty range: 28 000 to 142 000) die of cholera in endemic countries and 2500 people die of the disease in non-endemic countries. CONCLUSION: The global burden of cholera, as determined through a systematic review with clearly stated assumptions, is high. The findings of this study provide a contemporary basis for planning public health interventions to control cholera.},

Between 1970 and 2011, several European countries reported cholera outbreaks of a few to more than 2,000 cases. We report here a whole-genome analysis of 1,324 7 P V. cholerae El Tor (7 PET) isolates, including 172 from autochthonous sporadic or outbreak cholera cases occurring between 1970 and 2011 in Europe, providing insight into the spatial and temporal spread of this pathogen across Europe. In this work, we show that the 7 PET lineage was introduced at least eight times into two main regions: Eastern and Southern Europe. Greater recurrence of the disease was observed in Eastern Europe, where it persisted until 2011. It was introduced into this region from Southern Asia, often circulating regionally in the countries bordering the Black Sea, and in the Middle East before reaching Eastern Africa on several occasions. In Southern Europe, the disease was mostly seen in individual countries during the 1970s and was imported from North and West Africa, except in 1994, when cholera was imported into Albania and Italy from the Black Sea region.

	abstract = {Objectives
To describe the impact of preventive and control measures in Mexico prior to, and during, the cholera epidemic of 1991–2001.
Methods
When cholera appeared in Latin America in January 1991, the Mexican government considered that it represented a national security problem. Therefore, actions were implemented within the health sector (e.g. epidemiological surveillance, laboratory network and patient care) and other sectors (public education and basic sanitation).
Results
The first case occurred in Mexico in June 1991. The incidence rate remained below 17.9 per 100000 inhabitants and affected mainly rural areas. The last cholera report occurred in 2001. The disease never became endemic. The population benefited not only from acquisition of knowledge about preventive measures, but also from modification of risky practices and from reinforcement of city and municipal drinking water supplies.
Conclusion
Control strategies had an overall impact in decreasing diarrheal mortality among children under five years of age. Additionally the country did not suffer from a decrease in tourism or economic consequences. This experience can be considered as the operationalization of a new public health system spanning multisectorial activities, involving community participation, political will and with impact on public health and economic issues.},

	abstract = {Background: Vibrio cholera is a major contributor of diarrheal illness that causes signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality globally. While there is literature on the health economics of diarrheal illnesses more generally, few studies have quantiﬁed the cost-of-illness and cost-effectiveness of cholera-speciﬁc prevention and control interventions. The present systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature speciﬁc to cholera as it pertains to key health economic measures.
Methods: A systematic review was performed with no date restrictions up through February 2017 in PubMed, Econlit, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Review to identify relevant health economics of cholera literature. After removing duplicates, a total of 1993 studies were screened and coded independently by two reviewers, resulting in 22 relevant studies. Data on population, methods, and results (costof-illness and cost-effectiveness of vaccination) were compared by country/region. All costs were adjusted to 2017 USD for comparability.
Results: Costs per cholera case were found to be rather low: {\textless}\$100 per case in most settings, even when costs incurred by patients/families and lost productivity are considered. When wider socioeconomic costs are included, estimated costs are {\textgreater}\$1000/case. There is adequate evidence to support the economic value of vaccination for the prevention and control of cholera when vaccination is targeted at high-incidence populations and/or areas with high case fatality rates due to cholera. When herd immunity is considered, vaccination also becomes a cost-effective option for the general population and is comparable in costeffectiveness to other routine immunizations.
Conclusions: Cholera vaccination is a viable short-to-medium term option, especially as the upfront costs of building water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure are considerably higher for countries that face a signiﬁcant burden of cholera. While WASH may be the more cost-effective solution in the long-term when implemented properly, cholera vaccination can still be a feasible, cost-effective strategy. Ó 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

	volume = {43},
	abstract = {Popular reactions toward government efforts to control the recent cholera epidemic in
Northeast Brazil are evaluated. Intensive ethnographic interviews and participant-observation in two
urban slums OCavelas), reveal a high level of resistance on the part of impoverished residents towards olficial
cholera control interventions and mass media campaigns. "Non-compliance" with recommended regimens
is described more as a revolt against accusatory attitudes and actions of the elite than as an outright
rejection of care by the poor. "Hidden transcripts" about "The Dog's Disease," as cholera is popularly
called, voices a history of social and economic inequity and domination in Northeast Brazil. Here, cholera
is encumbered by the trappings of metaphor. Two lurid cultural stereotypes, pessoa imunda (filthy, dirty
person) and vira lata (stray mutt dog) are used, it is believed, to equate the poor with cholera. The morally
disgracing and disempowering imagery of cholera is used to blame and punish the poor and to collectively
taint and separate their communities from wealthy neighborhoods,
The authors argue that metaphoric trappings have tragic consequences: they deform the experience of
having cholera and inhibit the sick and dying from seeking treatment early enough. Controlling cholera
requires eliminating "blaming the victim" rhetoric while attacking the social roots of cholera: poverty,
low earning power, female illiteracy, sexism, lack of basic sanitation and clean water supplies, medical
hegemony, etc. For health interventions to be effective, it is necessary to take into account people's
"hidden transcripts" when designing action programs.},

Countries are highly interconnected with regard to primary regions of diversity of the crops they cultivate and/or consume.

However, changes in this diversity have not been quantified globally. We assess trends over the past 50 y in the richness, abundance, and composition of crop species in national food supplies worldwide. Over this period, national per capita food supplies expanded in total quantities of food calories, protein, fat, and weight, with increased proportions of those quantities sourcing from energy-dense foods. At the same time the number of measured crop commodities contributing to national food supplies increased, the relative contribution of these commodities within these supplies became more even, and the dominance of the most significant commodities decreased. As a consequence, national food supplies worldwide became more similar in composition, correlated particularly with an increased supply of a number of globally important cereal and oil crops, and a decline of other cereal, oil, and starchy root species. The increase in homogeneity worldwide portends the establishment of a global standard food supply, which is relatively species-rich in regard to measured crops at the national level, but species-poor globally. These changes in food supplies heighten interdependence among countries in regard to availability and access to these food sources and the genetic resources supporting their production, and give further urgency to nutrition development priorities aimed at bolstering food security.},

However, their conservation status and availability for utilization are a concern, and have not been quantified globally. Here, we model the global distribution of 1,076 taxa related to 81 crops, using occurrence information collected from biodiversity, herbarium and gene bank databases. We compare the potential geographic and ecological diversity encompassed in these distributions with that currently accessible in gene banks, as a means to estimate the comprehensiveness of the conservation of genetic diversity. Our results indicate that the diversity of crop wild relatives is poorly represented in gene banks. For 313 (29.1\% of total) taxa associated with 63 crops, no germplasm accessions exist, and a further 257 (23.9\%) are represented by fewer than ten accessions. Over 70\% of taxa are identified as high priority for further collecting in order to improve their representation in gene banks, and over 95\% are insufficiently represented in regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. The most critical collecting gaps occur in the Mediterranean and the Near East, western and southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America. We conclude that a systematic effort is needed to improve the conservation and availability of crop wild relatives for use in plant breeding.},

We focus specifically on the potential of botanic gardens as excellent partners for public engagement on CWR due to their presence in major population centers, knowledge of informal educational practices, and familiarity with plant biodiversity and agricultural crop species. We also discuss CWR outreach efforts outside of North America as well as related environmental education efforts within the region.

	abstract = {Habitat destruction and degradation are the leading causes of species declines and extinctions in the world. Human altered landscapes often leave fragments of previously continuous habitat, which may be of signiﬁcant conservation value. We assessed the effects of habitat fragmentation on the taxonomic diversity, community composition, and nestedness of avian communities before and after fragment isolation at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project research site in the Amazon rainforest. Species loss in 10ha and 100ha fragments was signiﬁcantly different from random taxonomic loss. In addition, after fragment isolation, but not prior to fragmentation, the species in the 10ha fragments were a nested subset of the species in the 100ha fragments. Finally, within the fragments two distinct communities formed, those on the edge of the fragments and those at the interior of the fragments, indicating that edge species did not penetrate the interior portion of the fragments. The controlled isolation of fragments from continuous forest resulted in rapid changes in the taxonomic diversity and species composition where fragment size served as a driver of species assemblages across the landscape. We suggest that future research continue to assess community level adjustments to habitat fragmentation and investigate the drivers behind the non-random loss of taxonomic groups and the nested structure of species composition of smaller fragments into larger ones after habitat fragmentation.},

	abstract = {Although habitat loss is the predominant factor leading to biodiversity loss in the Anthropocene1,2, exactly how this loss manifests—and at which scales—remains a central debate3–6. The ‘passive sampling’ hypothesis suggests that species are lost in proportion to their abundance and distribution in the natural habitat7,8, whereas the ‘ecosystem decay’ hypothesis suggests that ecological processes change in smaller and more-isolated habitats such that more species are lost than would have been expected simply through loss of habitat alone9,10. Generalizable tests of these hypotheses have been limited by heterogeneous sampling designs and a narrow focus on estimates of species richness that are strongly dependent on scale. Here we analyse 123 studies of assemblage-level abundances of focal taxa taken from multiple habitat fragments of varying size to evaluate the influence of passive sampling and ecosystem decay on biodiversity loss. We found overall support for the ecosystem decay hypothesis. Across all studies, ecosystems and taxa, biodiversity estimates from smaller habitat fragments—when controlled for sampling effort—contain fewer individuals, fewer species and less-even communities than expected from a sample of larger fragments. However, the diversity loss due to ecosystem decay in some studies (for example, those in which habitat loss took place more than 100 years ago) was less than expected from the overall pattern, as a result of compositional turnover by species that were not originally present in the intact habitats. We conclude that the incorporation of non-passive effects of habitat loss on biodiversity change will improve biodiversity scenarios under future land use, and planning for habitat protection and restoration.},

	abstract = {Climate change is expected to be a significant threat to biodiversity, including crop diversity at centers of origin and diversification. As a way to avoid food scarcity in the future, it is important to have a better understanding of the possible impacts of climate change on crops. We evaluated these impacts on maize, one of the most important crops worldwide, and its wild relatives Tripsacum and Teocintes. Maize is the staple crop in Mexico and Mesoamerica, and there are currently about 59 described races in Mexico, which is considered its center of origin . In this study, we modeled the distribution of maize races and its wild relatives in Mexico for the present and for two time periods in the future (2030 and 2050), to identify the potentially most vulnerable taxa and geographic regions in the face of climate change. Bioclimatic distribution of crops has seldom been modeled, probably because social and cultural factors play an important role on crop suitability. Nonetheless, rainfall and temperature still represent a major influence on crop distribution pattern, particularly in rainfed crop systems under traditional agrotechnology. Such is the case of Mexican maize races and consequently, climate change impacts can be expected. Our findings generally show significant reductions of potential distribution areas by 2030 and 2050 in most cases. However, future projections of each race show contrasting responses to climatic scenarios. Several evaluated races show new potential distribution areas in the future, suggesting that proper management may favor diversity conservation. Modeled distributions of Tripsacum species and Teocintes indicate more severe impacts compared with maize races. Our projections lead to in situ and ex situ conservation recommended actions to guarantee the preservation of the genetic diversity of Mexican maize.},

	abstract = {Metapopulation ecology and landscape ecology aim to understand how spatial structure influences ecological processes, yet these disciplines address the problem using fundamentally different modeling approaches. Metapopulation models describe how the spatial distribution of patches affects colonization and extinction, but often do not account for the heterogeneity in the landscape between patches. Models in landscape ecology use detailed descriptions of landscape structure, but often without considering colonization and extinction dynamics. We present a novel spatially explicit modeling framework for narrowing the divide between these disciplines to advance understanding of the effects of landscape structure on metapopulation dynamics. Unlike previous efforts, this framework allows for statistical inference on landscape resistance to colonization using empirical data. We demonstrate the approach using 11 yr of data on a threatened amphibian in a desert ecosystem. Occupancy data for Lithobates chiricahuensis (Chiricahua leopard frog) were collected on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge (BANWR), Arizona, USA from 2007 to 2017 following a reintroduction in 2003. Results indicated that colonization dynamics were influenced by both patch characteristics and landscape structure. Landscape resistance increased with increasing elevation and distance to the nearest streambed. Colonization rate was also influenced by patch quality, with semi-permanent and permanent ponds contributing substantially more to the colonization of neighboring ponds relative to intermittent ponds. Ponds that only hold water intermittently also had the highest extinction rate. Our modeling framework can be widely applied to understand metapopulation dynamics in complex landscapes, particularly in systems in which the environment between habitat patches influences the colonization process.},

This study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the Nutri-Score in various European countries, regarding its ability to discriminate the nutritional quality of foods and its consistency with national dietary recommendations. The European Food Information Resource (EUROFIR) nutritional composition databases from eight European countries (Finland, France, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland) were used. The distribution of foods across the Nutri-Score classes within food groups was assessed, as well as the discriminating performance of the label, and the adequacy of nutritional recommendations. The Nutri-Score demonstrated high discriminating ability for all food groups, with similar trends in the eight countries, and consistency with nutritional recommendations. For instance, fruit and vegetable products were mainly classiﬁed in the two healthiest Nutri-Score categories, while sugar and animal fat products were mainly classiﬁed in the two less healthy categories of the Nutri-Score. Our results support the fact that the Nutri-Score would be a relevant tool to discriminate the nutritional quality of products within and across relevant food groups in diﬀerent European countries, with consistency with nutritional recommendations.},

              Maize (corn) is the dominant grain grown in the world. Total maize production in 2018 equaled 1.12 billion tons. Maize is used primarily as an animal feed in the production of eggs, dairy, pork and chicken. The US produces 32\% of the world’s maize followed by China at 22\% and Brazil at 9\% (

              ). Accurate national-scale corn yield prediction critically impacts mercantile markets through providing essential information about expected production prior to harvest. Publicly available high-quality corn yield prediction can help address emergent information asymmetry problems and in doing so improve price efficiency in futures markets. We build a deep learning model to predict corn yields, specifically focusing on county-level prediction across 10 states of the Corn-Belt in the United States, and pre-harvest prediction with monthly updates from August. The results show promising predictive power relative to existing survey-based methods and set the foundation for a publicly available county yield prediction effort that complements existing public forecasts.},

Plant diversity substantially increased quality-adjusted yield and revenues. These findings hold for a wide range of management intensities, i.e., fertilization levels and cutting frequencies, in semi-natural grasslands. Plant diversity was an important production factor independent of management intensity, as it enhanced quality-adjusted yield and revenues similarly to increasing fertilization and cutting frequency. Consequently, maintaining and reestablishing plant diversity could be a way to sustainably manage temperate grasslands.},

                The open access edition of this book was made possible by generous funding from the MIT Libraries.
                    Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”
                    Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed.},

It is an indicator of socioeconomic problems and is a global threat to public health. Worldwide, approximately 3–5 million cholera cases and 100,000–120,000 deaths due to cholera occur annually. Cholera is transmitted by drinking water or eating food, which is contaminated with the Vibrio cholerae. Approximately 5–10\% of persons suffer from severe cholera and if untreated, 50\% of severe cases are fatal. The frequency, severity, and duration of cholera infection vary and keep on changing in different parts of the world. Environmental factors such as climate variability, temperature, and rainfall play an important role in cholera transmission. Population density, urbanization, and overcrowding also influence cholera transmission. It is also closely associated with the social and behavioral aspects of individuals as well as communities. Each year, many cholera outbreaks are reported from different regions of the world. These outbreaks have negative impact on social and economic conditions of the affected countries. An integrated, multisectoral program, designed on evidence-based interventions, is required to prevent and control cholera.},

	doi = {10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.98036.x},
	abstract = {Skeptics have questioned the empirical evidence that corridors provide landscape connectivity. Some also have suggested dangers of corridors. We reviewed published studies that empirically addressed whether corridors enhance or diminish the population viability of species in habitat patches connected by corridors. A randomized and replicated experimental design has not been used—and we argue is not required—to make inferences about the conservation value of corridors. Rather, studies can use observational or experimental analyses of parameters of target populations or movements of individual animals. Two of these approaches hold the greatest promise for progress, especially if the shortcomings of previous studies are remedied. First, experiments using demographic parameters as dependent variables—even if unreplicated—can demonstrate the demographic effects of particular corridors in particular landscapes. Such studies should measure demographic traits before and after treatment in both the treated area (corridor created or destroyed) and an untreated area (habitat patches isolated from one another). This approach is superior to observing the demographic conditions in various landscapes because of the tendency for corridor presence to be correlated with other variables, such as patch size, that can confound the analysis. Second, observations of movements by naturally dispersing animals in fragmented landscapes can demonstrate the conservation value of corridors more convincingly than can controlled experiments on animal movement. Such field observations relate directly to the type of animals (e.g., dispersing juveniles of target species) and the real landscapes that are the subject of decisions about corridor preservation. Future observational studies of animal movements should attempt to detect extra-corridor movements and focus on fragmentation-sensitive species for which corridors are likely to be proposed. Fewer than half of the 32 studies we reviewed provided persuasive data regarding the utility of corridors; other studies were inconclusive, largely due to design flaws. The evidence from well-designed studies suggests that corridors are valuable conservation tools. Those who would destroy the last remnants of natural connectivity should bear the burden of proving that corridor destruction will not harm target populations.
Proveen Conectividad los Corredores de Hábitat?
Algunos escépticos han cuestionado la evidencia empírica de que los corredores proveen conectividad al paisaje. Otros han sugerido los peligros de los corredores. Revisamos estudios publicados que abordaron empíricamente si los corredores fomentan o disminuyen la viabilidad de poblaciones de especies en parches de hábitat conectados por corredores. A la fecha no se ha llevado a cabo un diseño experimental randomizado y con réplicas para realizar inferencias sobre el valor de los corresdores en la conservación—y nosotros argüímos que no es necesario. En cambio, los estudios pueden emplear análisis observacional o experimental de parámetros de poblaciones de interés o movimientos individuales de animales. Dos de estas aproximaciones son muy prometedoras y pueden progresar, especialmente si las limitantes de los estudios previos son remediadas. Primero, los experimentos que usan parámetros demográficos como variables dependientes—aún si no son replicados—pueden demostrar efectos demográficos de corredores en paisajes particulares. Estos estudios deberán medir características demográficas antes y después del tratamiento, tanto en el área tratada (corredor creado o destruído) como en un área no tratada (parches de hábitat aislados unos de otros). Esta aproximación es superior a observar las condiciones demográficas en varios paisajes puesto que la presencia de un corredor tiende a estar correlacionada con otras variables, como lo es el tamaño del parche lo que puede confundir el análisis. Segundo, las observaciones de movimientos de animales que se desplazan normalmente en paisajes fragmentados puede demostrar el valor de los corredores en la conservación de manera mas convincente que los experimentos controlados sobre animales en movimiento. Este tipo de observaciones de campo están directamente relacionades con el tipo de animal (e.g., juveniles de la especie de interés dispersándose) y con el tipo de paisajes que están sujetos a las decisiones de preservación de corredores. Los estudios observacionales de movimientos de animales a futuro deberán tratar de detectar movimientos extra-corredores y enfocarse a especies sensitivas a la fragmentación y para las cuales los corredores son factibles a ser propuestos. Menos de la mitad de los 32 estudios revisados provee datos persuasivos referentes a la utilidad de los corredores; otros estudios fueron inconclusos, mayormente debido a diseños defectuosos. Las evidencias de estudios bien diseñados sugieren que los corredores son herramientas valiosas de conservación. Aquellos que intentan destruir los últimos remanentes de conectividad natural deberían sustentarse demostrando que la destrucción de los corredores no afectará a poblaciones de interés.},

	abstract = {Aim: The conservation and effective use of crop genetic diversity is crucial to overcome challenges related to human nutrition and agricultural sustainability. Farmers’ traditional varieties (“landraces”) are major sources of genetic variation. The degree of representation of crop landrace diversity in ex situ conservation is poorly understood, partly due to a lack of methods that can negotiate both the anthropogenic and environmental determinants of their geographic distributions. Here we describe a novel spatial modeling and ex situ conservation gap analysis modeling framework for crop landraces, using common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) as a case study. Location: The Americas Methods: The modeling framework includes five main steps: (1) determining relevant landrace groups using literature to develop and test classification models; (2) modeling the potential geographic distributions of these groups using occurrence (landrace presences) combined with environmental and socioeconomic predictor data; (3) calculating geographic and environmental gap scores for current genebank collections; (4) mapping ex situ conservation gaps; and (5) compiling expert inputs. Results: Modeled distributions and conservation gaps for the two genepools of common bean (Andean and Mesoamerican) were robustly predicted and align well with expert opinions. Both genepools are relatively well conserved, with Andean ex situ collections representing 78.5\% and Mesoamerican 98.2\% of their predicted geographic distributions. Modelling revealed additional collection priorities for Andean landraces occur primarily in Chile, Peru, Colombia and, to a lesser extent, in Venezuela. Mesoamerican landrace collecting priorities are concentrated in Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala. Conclusions: The modeling framework represents an advance in tools that can be deployed to model the geographic distributions of cultivated crop diversity, to assess the comprehensiveness of conservation of this diversity ex situ, and to highlight geographic areas where further collecting may be conducted to fill gaps in ex situ conservation.},

	title = {Putting {Gender} on the {Map}},
	abstract = {Although the different roles of men and women in agriculture in different parts of Sub-Saharan Africa have been widely acknowledged, there have not been consistent efforts to collect data on these patterns. This paper presents a way of classifying gendered farm management systems and then describes pilots of four different approaches to collecting and georeferencing information on the dominant pattern in each area. Case studies from existing literature provided valuable insights but represent a time-consuming method, limited in spatial coverage and often leaving gaps because the original study authors did not report on all of the aspects of interest for a gendered farm management systems analysis. Expert consultations conducted in Ghana and Zambia allowed for dialogue among participants during map development, permitting them to explore nuances and dynamics. However, this technique may be restricted in scale to one country at a time, limiting cross-national comparison. An open online survey, or crowdsourcing, of the information tapped into a wide range of expertise, providing difficult-to-obtain widespread coverage, but had inconsistent data quality. Mapping of georeferenced information from nationally representative data could potentially provide widespread and relatively accurate data, but thus far the relevant underlying data have not been consistently included in large-scale surveys. Gender mapping offers an important step toward greater awareness of the diverse gender roles in agricultural farm management systems, but gaps remain between field reality and the understanding of gender relations in research, on the one hand, and between the researchers‘ understanding and what can be displayed on a map, on the other. Addressing these gaps requires developing a consensus on the key variables that characterize gendered farming systems, collecting these data systematically, and then linking the data to other spatial information for use in planning and prioritizing development interventions.},

	abstract = {This study explores the role of gender-based decision-making in the adoption of improved maize varieties. The primary data were collected in 2018 from 560 farm households in Dawuro Zone, Ethiopia, and were comparatively analyzed across gender categories of households: male decision-making, female decision-making and joint decision-making, using a double-hurdle model. The results show that the intensity of improved maize varieties adopted on plots managed by male, female, and joint decision-making households are significantly different. This effect diminishes in the model when we take other factors into account. Using the gender of the heads of households and agricultural decision-maker, the current study did not find significant evidence of gender difference in the rate and intensity of adoption of improved maize varieties. The intensity of adoption of improved maize varieties is lower for female-headed households where decisions are made jointly by men and women, compared to the male-headed households where decisions are made jointly. As the economic status is a key driver of adoption of improved maize varieties, it is recommended that the policies and programs that aim at developing and disseminating quality maize seeds in southern Ethiopia should emphatically support economically less endowed but more gender egalitarian joint decision-making households, especially female-headed ones.},

This article analyzes the challenges in distinguishing women's agricultural productivity from that of men. Most of the literature compares productivity on plots managed by women with those managed by men, ignoring the majority of agricultural households in which men and women are both involved in management and production. The empirical studies which have been carried out provide scant evidence for where the returns to projects may be highest, in terms of who to target. Yet, programmes that do not consider gendered responsibilities, resources and constraints, are unlikely to succeed, either in terms of increasing productivity or benefitting men and women smallholder farmers.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-022665-7},
	abstract = {Food has, for most of our species history, been intensely political: who gets to eat what, how often, and through what means? The scale of polity in question has shifted over time, from very local institutions dividing up grain piles to an international community imagined in the Millennium Development Goals of the United Nations. Simultaneously, the numbers and interests of people asserting political stakes in food and agriculture have likewise shifted up and out. Global networks advocate social justice in distal agrarian systems, promotion of some farming techniques and prohibition of others, food sovereignty or efficiencies of markets and trade. Political consumerism allows the well-endowed to "vote with their dollars" for changes in food systems far from home, but depends on certification and labeling from unseen institutions. As an object of governmentality, food has never been so prominent. The thirty-five handbook chapters confront four major themes in the politics of food: property, technology, justice and knowledge. Ronald Herring's editorial introduction asks how food is political, highlighting contention around the role of market, state and information in societal decisions. The first section of the handbook then examines technology, science and knowledge in food production. What is known - and disputed - about malnutrition, poverty and food security? The second section addresses ethics, rights and distributive justice: agrarian reform, gender inequality, entitlements and subsidies, and the social vision of the alternative food movement. The third section looks to intersections of agriculture and nature: wild foods, livestock, agro-ecological approaches to sustainability, and climate change and genetic engineering. The fourth section addresses food values and culture: political consumerism, labeling and certification, the science and cultural politics of food safety, values driving regulation of genetically modified foods and potential coexistence of GMOs, and organic and conventional crops. The fifth and final section looks at frontiers of global contentions: rival transnational advocacy networks, social movements for organic farming, the who and why of international land grabbing, junctures of cosmopolitan and local food narratives, the "supermarket revolution" and the international agrifood industry in low-income countries, and politics of knowledge in agricultural futures.},

When managed by using biodiversity-based techniques such as agroforestry, silvopasture, diversified farming, and ecosystem-based forest management, these socioeconomic systems can help maintain biodiversity and provide habitat connectivity, thereby complementing protected areas and providing greater resilience to climate change. Simultaneously, the use of these management techniques can improve yields and profitability more sustainably, enhancing livelihoods and food security. This approach to “working lands conservation” can create landscapes that work for nature and people. However, many socioeconomic challenges impede the uptake of biodiversity-based land management practices. Although improving voluntary incentives, market instruments, environmental regulations, and governance is essential to support working lands conservation, it is community action, social movements, and broad coalitions among citizens, businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies that have the power to transform how we manage land and protect the environment.},

Through a review of country-level legislation, we found that just 38\% of countries have minimum area requirements for conserving native habitats within working landscapes. We argue for increasing native habitats to at least 20\% of working landscape area where it is below this minimum. Such target has benefits for food security, nature's contributions to people, and the connectivity and effectiveness of protected area networks in biomes in which protected areas are underrepresented. We also argue for maintaining native habitat at higher levels where it currently exceeds the 20\% minimum, and performed a literature review that shows that even more than 50\% native habitat restoration is needed in particular landscapes. The post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework is an opportune moment to include a minimum habitat restoration target for working landscapes that contributes to, but does not compete with, initiatives for expanding protected areas, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021–2030) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.},

	abstract = {How do we redesign agricultural landscapes to maintain their productivity and profitability, while promoting rather than eradicating biodiversity, and regenerating rather than undermining the ecological processes that sustain food production and are vital for a liveable planet? Ecological intensification harnesses ecological processes to increase food production per area through management processes that often diversify croplands to support beneficial organisms supplying these services. By adding more diverse vegetation back into landscapes, the agricultural matrix can also become both more habitable and more permeable to biodiversity, aiding in conserving biodiversity over time. By reducing the need for costly inputs while maintaining productivity, ecological intensification methods can maintain or even enhance profitability. As shown with several examples, ecological intensification and diversification can assist in creating multifunctional landscapes that are more environmentally and economically sustainable. While single methods of ecological intensification can be incorporated into large-scale industrial farms and reduce negative impacts, complete redesign of such systems using multiple methods of ecological intensification and diversification can create truly regenerative systems with strong potential to promote food production and biodiversity. However, the broad adoption of these methods will require transformative socio-economic changes because many structural barriers continue to maintain the current agrichemical model of agriculture.},

The long and narrow form of the Mesoamerican landmass, and its division by a central mountain range, has served as both a bridge and a barrier. Conservation efforts in Mesoamerica are unique for the emphasis they place on regional connectivity through the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor and on biodiversity conservation in managed landscapes. The emphasis on conservation in agricultural systems has fostered innovations in payment for ecosystem services, and provides novel insights on the functional role that biodiversity plays in the provisioning of ecosystem services. The increasing rate of economic development in the region and the advent of new payment for ecosystem service schemes have provided new opportunities for forest regeneration and restoration. However, the small scale of private landholdings and the diversity of land uses featured in the region, while contributing to biodiversity conservation due to their structural and floristic complexity, present challenges for biodiversity monitoring and management.},

STE literature has increased dramatically since 2000, particularly for marine protected areas (MPAs), but remains limited. Few studies use rigorous counterfactual study designs, and significant research gaps remain regarding specific wellbeing domains (culture, education), social groups (gender, age, ethnic groups), and impacts over time. Practitioners and researchers should recognize the role of shifting property rights, power asymmetries, individual capabilities, and resource dependency in shaping STE in conservation outcomes, and utilize multi-consequential frameworks to support the wellbeing of vulnerable and marginalized groups.},

Some of these solutions, such as evidence-based conservation, are based on the assumption that the gap exists primarily because of a communication problem in getting reliable and needed technical information to decision makers. First, we identify conceptual weaknesses with this framing, supporting our arguments with decades of research in other fields of study. We then reconceptualize the gap as a series of crucial, productive spaces in which shared interests, value conflicts, and complex relations between scientists and publics can interact. Whereas synonyms for “gap” include words such as “chasm,” “rift,” or “breach,” the word “space” is connected with words such as “arena,” “capacity,” and “place” and points to who and what already exists in a specific context. Finally, we offer ways forward for applying this new understanding in practice.},

	abstract = {Conservation biologists are devoting an increasing amount of energy to debating whether land sparing (high-yielding agriculture on a small land footprint) or land sharing (low-yielding, wildlife-friendly agriculture on a larger land footprint) will promote better outcomes for local and global biodiversity. In turn, concerns are mounting about how to feed the world, given increasing demands for food. In this review, I evaluate the land-sparing/land-sharing framework—does the framework stimulate research and policy that can reconcile agricultural land use with biodiversity conservation, or is a revised framing needed? I review (1) the ecological evidence in favor of sparing versus sharing; (2) the evidence from land-use change studies that assesses whether a relationship exists between agricultural intensification and land sparing; and (3) how that relationship may be affected by socioeconomic and political factors. To address the trade-off between biodiversity conservation and food production, I then ask which forms of agricultural intensification can best feed the world now and in the future. On the basis of my review, I suggest that the dichotomy of the land-sparing/land-sharing framework limits the realm of future possibilities to two, largely undesirable, options for conservation. Both large, protected regions and favorable surrounding matrices are needed to promote biodiversity conservation; they work synergistically and are not mutually exclusive. A “both-and” framing of large protected areas surrounded by a wildlife-friendly matrix suggests different research priorities from the “either-or” framing of sparing versus sharing. Furthermore, wildlife-friendly farming methods such as agroecology may be best adapted to provide food for the world's hungry people.},

	abstract = {Costa Rica established the National Biological Corridor Program in 2006. Under the National Biological Corridor Program, the long-running Payment for Environmental Services Program was newly prioritized into biological corridors throughout the country. The National Biological Corridor Program caused a nationwide spatial shift in placement of payments for environmental services throughout Costa Rica. We classified ASTER 15-m resolution imagery in a central Costa Rica corridor connecting the eastern and western protected areas networks to analyze the change in forests during the National Biological Corridor Program with its targeted payments for environmental services effort. We used object-based classification methods, and compared land cover changes over an initial four-year period of corridor policy enactment. We calculated the changes within PES properties and outside of PES regions, and we also calculated forest patch metrics during the same time period. Results indicate a decline in forest cover over the study period, along with an increase in urban and pasture land covers, with higher change and loss of forest centered inside of the biological corridor, near the construction area for the new San Carlos highway, and within eastern pasture areas. We also saw a higher percentage of forest loss inside of the biological corridor area as compared to areas outside of the biological corridor. Forest loss was drastically less within current and historic PES properties, as compared to the overall study region. Across the entire study region, patch metrics show a decrease in the number of patches and a slight decrease in average patch size. These results suggest that current and past designation of PES prevents forest loss within PES properties while the current designation of priority conservation status via the National Biological Corridor Program is not increasing connectivity and forest conservation. This is shown by increased land use change and a decrease in forest associated with biological corridor designation. These results are antithetical to the goals of the National Biological Corridor Program.},

	abstract = {NASA signed a joint statement with the general secretariat of the 
Central American Integration System (SICA) in March 2019, following up
an earlier 15-year memorandum of understanding between NASA and the
Central American Commission for the Environment \& Development, a
SICA sub-secretariat. A key goal of the collaboration is increased
application of Earth observation data to protect the region's natural
heritage, including the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC), which is
home to almost 10\% of the world's terrestrial vertebrate species. The
forests of the MBC also have an important role related to hydrological
regulation. Toward understanding that, a retrospective study (1980-2010)
was done using data derived from satellite resources such as Landsat and
MODIS, and complemented by land use scenario modeling cover the period
2010-2100. The data indicate that over three decades, forest cover
across the region had declined by almost half, from 72\% in 1980 to 42\%
in 2010. Additionally, a 'business as usual' trend in land cover change
would translate to a decline in Central America's forest cover to {\textasciitilde}24.3\%
by 2050. To study the potential impacts of such land cover change on
hydrology, we examined the Samalá River watershed in Guatemala,
home to Guatemala's 2 nd largest population center, and whose
heterogenous landscape is representative of Central America's
watersheds. For that watershed, it was estimated that forest cover fell
from 22\% in 2003 to only 9\% in 2019, a decrease of almost 60\%. Based on
hydrological modeling, it was found that the effect of such drastic
forest cover change resulted in an increase in surface runoff by 7\%, a
corresponding 4\% decrease in groundwater infiltration, but a 31\%
increase in sediment delivery. With the Samalá River being
emblematic of the challenges affecting watersheds in Central America,
the implications of such will be further explored in this talk.},

	abstract = {Background: Human impact over natural ecosystems located in Southern Mexico is increasingly evident. We generated a spatially explicit land use and cover change (LUCC) model to assess current and potential impact of human activities and to identify the influence of variables such as: distance to paved and unpaved roads, human settlements, rivers, slope and protected areas.
Study site: Mesoamerican Biological Corridor located in the state of Chiapas (MBC-Ch), Mexico.
Methods: We calibrated a model for the period 1993-2002 and ran a simulation for 2007 which we compared against the real 2007 land use and cover map to evaluate model’s performance. We then projected LUCC to 2030 under three different scenarios: 1) Agriculture and Livestock (AGL), 2) Business As Usual (BAU) and, 3) Conservation (CON).
Results: Proximity to roads and settlements increased deforestation probabilities whereas the presence of natural protected areas had the opposite effect. The AGL scenario predicted a reduction of 43 \% and 41 \% in the extent of closed tropical and temperate forests, respectively. In comparison, the BAU scenario predicted a reduction of 19.5\% in the area covered by closed tropical forest and of 30.1 \% in temperate forests. The extent of land destined to farming and forestry increased by 22 \% and 15 \% in the AGL and BAU scenarios, respectively. In contrast, the CON scenario predicted slight changes in the landscape.
Conclusions: Our simulations indicate that it is highly probable to see a marked decay in the extent (and likely integrity) of natural habitats in the MBC-Ch region if a comprehensive series of management actions are not urgently implemented.},

	abstract = {The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor (MBC) was established in the 1990s 
as a network of protected areas straddling the Central American isthmus.
While the strip of land spanning 7 nations represents less than 1\% of
Earth's land surface, it houses some 9.4\% of the world's terrestrial
vertebrate species. Since the 1980s, conjectural evidence suggested that
the region's teeming biodiversity was being threatened by widespread
deforestation. The objective of this study was therefore to use remote
sensing to quantify rates of change across the MBC, and to determine the
drivers for such change. In the 1st part of the analysis,
satellite data from Landsat and MODIS were used to construct
regional-scale land cover maps for 4 periods: c. 1980, c. 1990, c. 2000,
and 2010. The data were validated (88\% overall accuracy) using field
surveys, and the analysis demonstrated that the region's forest cover
declined from 72.5\% in mean year 1980 to 42.4\% in 2010, with forests
mainly being displaced by pastures. To a lesser extent, forests were
also cleared for the expansion of croplands, and for urban expansion. In
total, forest cover declined from approx. 373,000 km2 in c.
1980 to 217,000 km2 in 2010, a loss of over two fifths of the
forests extant in 1980. Complementing that, the 2nd part of
the analysis examined annual trends in forest cover derived solely from
MODIS data. In contrast to the findings of the first part of the study,
these results suggest that since 2010, forest cover in Central America
may have rebounded, with one analysis indicating that forest cover in
early 2018 rose to 51.8\%. Such trends - which remain to be validated -
may be linked to global economic downturns, which may have translated to
lower demand for agricultural exports. Where such findings, however, may
also be linked to how forests are discriminated spectrally, as well as
the impacts of secondary regrowth, such implications will also be
further explored in this paper.},

	abstract = {In a move toward the integration of social and ecological goals in land management, landscape approaches are now a part of mainstream conservation and development policy discourses worldwide. Policies for integrated landscape management in Mesoamerica have long promoted biological corridors as a way to enhance biodiversity conservation and habitat connectivity while improving livelihoods in the surrounding landscape matrix. Recently, though, the policy focus throughout the region has shifted toward landscape restoration, which subsumes and expands upon the former approach to respond more explicitly to concerns about climate change. However, the limited success and challenges of translating corridors from paper into practice raise questions about the potential of landscape restoration policies to achieve intended outcomes. Centering on the experience of El Salvador, this paper draws on policy and document analysis and interviews with professionals to compare the two approaches and explore the implications of the transition toward landscape restoration based on lessons learned from past corridor implementation challenges. The paper argues that while the two approaches share many core components and objectives, landscape restoration has different spatial and distributional implications in terms of priority-setting, distribution of resources and benefits, and the promotion of conservation management strategies and alternatives. Nevertheless, unresolved challenges of integrated landscape management revealed by decades of unsuccessful corridor implementation must be addressed if restoration policies are to make headway. Through a critical analysis of shifting policy frameworks in El Salvador, the research offers crucial insight into the limitations and possibilities of integrated landscape management in Mesoamerica and globally.},

            This study examines the impact of gender differences on maize productivity in Dawuro Zone, southern Ethiopia. Our study addressed the limitations of the previous studies in two ways. First, the study separately assessed gender differences in productivity between de facto female-headed households and de jure female-headed households and revealed that female-headed households are not homogenous. Second, the study separately examined the impacts of the covariates on male-headed households and female-headed households using an exogenous switching treatment effect model. We find the existence of gender differences in maize productivity between male-headed households and female-headed households. The maize productivity of male-headed households was overall 44.3\% higher than that of female-headed households. However, if female-headed households received the same return on their resources as male-headed households, their productivity would increase by 42.3\%. This suggests agricultural policy should target female-headed households to help reduce the productivity gap between male-headed households and female-headed households. Finally, the distributions of the gender differentials between male-headed households and female-headed households are more pronounced at mid-levels of productivity.},

When managed by using biodiversity-based techniques such as agroforestry, silvopasture, diversified farming, and ecosystem-based forest management, these socioeconomic systems can help maintain biodiversity and provide habitat connectivity, thereby complementing protected areas and providing greater resilience to climate change. Simultaneously, the use of these management techniques can improve yields and profitability more sustainably, enhancing livelihoods and food security. This approach to “working lands conservation” can create landscapes that work for nature and people. However, many socioeconomic challenges impede the uptake of biodiversity-based land management practices. Although improving voluntary incentives, market instruments, environmental regulations, and governance is essential to support working lands conservation, it is community action, social movements, and broad coalitions among citizens, businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies that have the power to transform how we manage land and protect the environment.},

	abstract = {The Anthropocene epoch is partly defined by anthropogenic spread of crops beyond their centres of origin. At global scales, evidence indicates that species-level taxonomic diversity of crops being cultivated on large-scale agricultural lands has increased linearly over the past 50 years. Yet environmental and socio-economic differences support expectations that temporal changes in crop diversity vary across regions. Ecological theory also suggests that changes in crop taxonomic diversity may not necessarily reflect changes in the evolutionary diversity of crops. We used data from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations to assess changes in crop taxonomic- and phylogenetic diversity across 22 subcontinental-scale regions from 1961–2014. We document certain broad consistencies across nearly all regions: i) little change in crop diversity from 1961 through to the late 1970s; followed by ii) a 10-year period of sharp diversification through the early 1980s; followed by iii) a “levelling-off” of crop diversification beginning in the early 1990s. However, the specific onset and duration of these distinct periods differs significantly across regions and are unrelated to agricultural expansion, indicating that unique policy or environmental conditions influence the crops being grown within a given region. Additionally, while the 1970s and 1980s are defined by region-scale increases in crop diversity this period marks the increasing dominance of a small number of crop species and lineages; a trend resulting in detectable increases in the similarity of crops being grown across regions. Broad similarities in the species-level taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity of crops being grown across regions, primarily at large industrial scales captured by FAO data, represent a unique feature of the Anthropocene epoch. Yet nuanced asymmetries in regional-scale trends suggest that environmental and socio-economic factors play a key role in shaping observed macro-ecological changes in the plant diversity on agricultural lands.},

However, formal analyses to document such changes are lacking. Using US Agriculture Census data, which are collected every five years, we quantified crop species diversity from 1978 to 2012, for the contiguous US on a county level basis. We used Shannon diversity indices expressed as effective number of crop species (ENCS) to quantify crop diversity. We then evaluated changes in county-level crop diversity both nationally and for each of the eight Farm Resource Regions developed by the National Agriculture Statistics Service. During the 34 years we considered in our analyses, both national and regional ENCS changed. Nationally, crop diversity was lower in 2012 than in 1978. However, our analyses also revealed interesting trends between and within different Resource Regions. Overall, the Heartland Resource Region had the lowest crop diversity whereas the Fruitful Rim and Northern Crescent had the highest. In contrast to the other Resource Regions, the Mississippi Portal had significantly higher crop diversity in 2012 than in 1978. Also, within regions there were differences between counties in crop diversity. Spatial autocorrelation revealed clustering of low and high ENCS and this trend became stronger over time. These results show that, nationally counties have been clustering into areas of either low diversity or high diversity. Moreover, a significant trend of more counties shifting to lower rather than to higher crop diversity was detected. The clustering and shifting demonstrates a trend toward crop diversity loss and attendant homogenization of agricultural production systems, which could have far-reaching consequences for provision of ecosystem system services associated with agricultural systems as well as food system sustainability.},

Vulnerability is the state of susceptibility to harm from exposure to stresses associated with environmental and social change and from the absence of capacity to adapt. Antecedent traditions include theories of vulnerability as entitlement failure and theories of hazard. Each of these areas has contributed to present formulations of vulnerability to environmental change as a characteristic of social-ecological systems linked to resilience. Research on vulnerability to the impacts of climate change spans all the antecedent and successor traditions. The challenges for vulnerability research are to develop robust and credible measures, to incorporate diverse methods that include perceptions of risk and vulnerability, and to incorporate governance research on the mechanisms that mediate vulnerability and promote adaptive action and resilience. These challenges are common to the domains of vulnerability, adaptation and resilience and form common ground for consilience and integration.},

	abstract = {Increasing crop species diversity can enhance agricultural sustainability, but the scale dependency of the processes that shape diversity and of the effects of diversity on agroecosystems is insufficiently understood. We used 30 m spatial resolution crop classification data for the conterminous United States to analyze spatial and temporal crop species diversity and their relationship. We found that the US average temporal (crop rotation) diversity is 2.1 effective number of species and that a crop’s average temporal diversity is lowest for common crops. Spatial diversity monotonically increases with the size of the unit of observation, and it is most strongly associated with temporal diversity when measured for areas of 100 to 400 ha, which is the typical US farm size. The association between diversity in space and time weakens as data are aggregated over larger areas because of the increasing diversity among farms, but at intermediate aggregation levels (counties) it is possible to estimate temporal diversity and farm-scale spatial diversity from aggregated spatial crop diversity data if the effect of beta diversity is considered. For larger areas, the diversity among farms is usually much greater than the diversity within them, and this needs to be considered when analyzing large-area crop diversity data. US agriculture is dominated by a few major annual crops (maize, soybean, wheat) that are mostly grown on fields with a very low temporal diversity. To increase crop species diversity, currently minor crops would have to increase in area at the expense of these major crops.},

	abstract = {Declines in agricultural biodiversity associated with modern farming practices may negatively affect the sustainability of agro-ecosystems, but formal knowledge of historical variation in spatio-temporal variation of agro-biodiversity is limited. We used time series of national (1947–2014) and district-level (1956–2008) crop distribution data for India to show that despite strong agricultural intensification after 1960, the average crop species diversity at the district level was stable, but increased at the country-level. While there was a decline in diversity in the major rice and wheat producing regions of northwestern India, associated with intensification of the production of these crops, diversity in western and southern India increased due to expansion of oilseeds and horticultural crops that replaced millet and sorghum. These opposite, but related, trends in crop-level diversity at the sub-national level partially canceled each other out at national level, but there nevertheless was a noticeable increase in overall crop diversity in India during this time period. Our results illustrate how patterns of change in crop diversity need to be considered at different levels of aggregation, and how a decrease in diversity associated with intensification and specialization in one area, may be associated with increased diversity elsewhere, and that support for intensive agriculture with relatively low crop diversity in some regions may be associated with an increase in crop diversity in other regions and at a higher level of aggregation.},

Although few people will dispute that global food systems need transformation, it has become clear that the Summit is instead an effort by a powerful alliance of multinational corporations, philanthropies, and export-oriented countries to subvert multilateral institutions of food governance and capture the global narrative of ‘food systems transformation.’ This article places the upcoming Summit in the context of previous world food summits and analyzes concerns that have been voiced by many within civil society. It elaborates how the current structure and forms of participant recruitment and public engagement lack basic transparency and accountability, fail to address significant conflicts of interest, and ignore human rights. As the COVID-19 pandemic illuminates the structural vulnerabilities of the neoliberal model of food systems and the effects of climate change increasingly effect food production, a high-level commitment to equitable and sustainable food systems is needed now more than ever. However, the authors suggest that the UNFSS instead seems to follow a trajectory in which efforts to govern global food systems in the public interest has been subverted to maintain colonial and corporate forms of control.},

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; . . . who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.” —Theodore RooseveltEvery day we experience the uncertainty, risks, and emotional exposure that define what it means to be vulnerable, or to dare greatly. Whether the arena is a new relationship, an important meeting, our creative process, or a difficult family conversation, we must find the courage to walk into vulnerability and engage with our whole hearts.In Daring Greatly, Dr. Brown challenges everything we think we know about vulnerability. Based on twelve years of research, she argues that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather our clearest path to courage, engagement, and meaningful connection. The book that Dr. Brown’s many fans have been waiting for, Daring Greatly will spark a new spirit of truth—and trust—in our organizations, families, schools, and communities.},

	abstract = {Powerful international development institutions have called for a ‘gender data revolution.’ They posit that progress on gender equality depends upon our collective ability to close ‘the gender data gap,’ by which they mean that we know less about women’s lives than men’s in statistical terms. Some feminists within and outside the academy treat the gender data revolution with suspicion, likening it to a ‘measurement obsession’ (Liebowitz and Zwingel 2014) that is overly quantitative (Buss 2015) and ill-fit to capture the complexities of gender subordination. In this paper, we suggest that feminist geographers as academics and scholar-activists have a unique and important contribution to make to the gender data debate, which at present is largely aspatial. Drawing on empirical examples we first illustrate how feminist geography’s conceptual and methodological contributions enrich the gender data debate; second, we reflect on the possibilities and limitations of a practical intervention that we are currently staging as co-founders of a feminist research venture that seeks to shape policymaking, critically considering the possibilities and limitations of such an endeavour.},

CIET has standardised a community-based cross-design for the gender-sensitive collection and analysis of three types of evidence: impact, coverage, and costs. Five steps help to ensure that women's voices are heard in planning. Gender-stratified analysis of existing data is a starting point. Stratification of all responses by sex of the respondent prevents a numerical bias in favour of men translating into a gender bias in the analysis. Female focus groups inform survey design, interpretation, and appropriate strategies for change. Gender is a factor in risk and resilience analysis. Finally, gender-sensitive logistics ensure women's equal participation. First-order outputs include actionable gender data to advocate in favour of women. Second-order outputs include an enabling environment for equitable development, challenging the gendered patterns of economic marginalisation.},

A gender imbalance in the energy sector workforce is apparent in countries throughout the world, yet women's participation in, and contributions to, the energy industry have not been systematically characterized. As the energy sector transitions from fossil-fuel dominated systems toward more efficient, sustainable renewable-based systems, new opportunities for a more inclusive energy workforce are emerging. We are concerned, however, that if the energy industry does not prioritize gender diversity now, the renewable energy transition could perpetuate and deepen, rather than reduce, gender inequality. Although research demonstrates that diversity enhances innovation and creativity, there is minimal attention to considering and promoting diversity within the energy workforce. In this Community Essay we explore how greater consideration of the role of gender and the value of diversity in energy could provide multiple social benefits, including promoting more sustainable practices, accelerating innovation, enhancing women's opportunities, and empowering communities to engage in energy-system change.},

	abstract = {To achieve gender equality and women empowerment it is essential to have complete data on the multiple and intersecting ways in which women and girls experience poverty, discrimination and violence. Gender data is crucial: without it, it is extremely difficult to design policies and programs which respond to the differential needs and experiences of all categories of men and women. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) has pledged to tackle the gender gap by 2030. The transformative agenda of sustainable development is underpinned by a strong statement of inclusion - 'leave no one behind'. Despite increased attention towards improving gender statistics, in the last two decades, there exists a glaring data gap. This state of affairs presents a real test towards achieving the ambitious scope of Agenda 2030. This paper discusses the significance, achievements and gaps on the gender data front. Further the paper establishes the necessity to develop and budget for newer approaches to bridge the gender data gap by 2030. The paper enumerates an innovative method of data collection from Surguja, Chhattisgarh and highlights ways in which it helped the government to expand its services and effectively respond to the needs of all categories of single women in the state.},

In pursuing the 2030 Sustainability Development Goals (SDGs), the availability of high-quality gender-sensitive data has generated the current informative outburst. In the process, gender-sensitive data collection has departed from a mere disaggregation between men and women towards an unprecedented multifaceted informational spectrum. Methods for fully exploiting gender-sensitive statistics, both standard and big data, though, face some levels of criticality. The traditional descriptive linear combinations of a collection of simple indicators yields contradictory order results, whereas inference has so far privileged latent modelling only, holding several constraints. A novel statistical perspective stems from recent developments in multivariate latent Markov models (MLMMs), suitable to express a latent characteristic in both time and space. In addition to introducing covariates, on any measurement scale, not only in the measurement model but also the latent one, MLMMs are innovative such that they can handle a vast mass of data from very different sources. Thus, they lead the way to an extensive investigation of the gender gap, accounting for apparent contradictions in rankings and hence highlighting different paths, or transitions, towards a more equitable society.},

Despite the difficulties, we contend that blending insights from the EBP and WP literatures can provide actionable and practical policy advice to governments and MNEs for dealing with the WPs of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We support our thesis with a case study applying EBP to the WP of SDG 5 Gender Equality. We compare the statistical evidence from gender inequality indexes to SDG 5’s targets and indicators. We provide five insights from the EBP and WP literatures into why and how good evidence is necessary but not sufficient for progress on SDG 5. Building on these insights, we recommend that governments adopt an EBP approach employing public–private partnerships to address SDG 5. We also recommend that MNE executives use our new SDG Materiality Matrix, designed on EBP principles, to build SDG 5 into their global corporate social responsibility strategies.},

We compare a sharp-transition model with three models incorporating smooth transitions: the hyperbolic-tangent, bent-hyperbola, and bent-cable models. We also calculate three types of confidence intervals for the breakpoint estimate: an interval based on the computed standard error of the estimate from the fitting procedure, an empirical bootstrap confidence interval, and a confidence interval derived from an inverted F test. We recommend use of the inverted F test confidence interval when sample sizes are large, and cautious use of bootstrapped confidence intervals when sample sizes are smaller. Our analysis demonstrates the need for a careful study of the likelihood surface when fitting and interpreting the results from piecewise-regression models.},

Despite the tight historical links between science and philosophy, present-day scientists often perceive philosophy as completely different from, and even antagonistic to, science. We argue here that, to the contrary, philosophy can have an important and productive impact on science.



Despite the tight historical links between science and philosophy, hearkening back to Plato, Aristotle, and others (here evoked with Raphael’s famous School of Athens), present-day scientists often perceive philosophy as completely different from, and even antagonistic to, science. To the contrary, we believe philosophy can have an important and productive impact on science. Image credit: Shutterstock.com/Isogood\_patrick.



We illustrate our point with three examples taken from various fields of the contemporary life sciences. Each bears on cutting-edge scientific research, and each has been explicitly acknowledged by practicing researchers as a useful contribution to science. These and other examples show that philosophy’s contribution can take at least four forms: the clarification of scientific concepts, the critical assessment of scientific assumptions or methods, the formulation of new concepts and theories, and the fostering of dialogue between different sciences, as well as between science and society.

\#\#\# Conceptual Clarification and Stem Cells.

First, philosophy offers conceptual clarification. Conceptual clarifications not only improve the precision and utility of scientific terms but also lead to novel experimental investigations because the choice of a given conceptual framework strongly constrains how experiments are conceived.

The definition of stem cells is a prime example. Philosophy has a long tradition of investigating properties, and the tools in use in this tradition …

Gender Equality and Sustainable Development calls for policies, investments and initiatives in sustainable development that recognize women’s knowledge, agency and decision-making as fundamental. Four key sets of issues - work and industrial production; population and reproduction; food and agriculture, and water, sanitation and energy provide focal lenses through which these challenges are considered. Perspectives from new feminist political ecology and economy are integrated, alongside issues of rights, relations and power. The book untangles the complex interactions between different dimensions of gender relations and of sustainability, and explores how policy and activism can build synergies between them. Finally, this book demonstrates how plural pathways are possible; underpinned by different narratives about gender and sustainability, and how the choices between these are ultimately political. This timely book will be of great interest to students, scholars, practitioners and policy makers working on gender, sustainable development, development studies and ecological economics.},

	abstract = {Agricultural and reproductive technologies ostensibly represent opposing poles within discourses on population growth: one aims to ‘feed the world,’ while the other seeks to limit the number of mouths there are to feed. There is, however, an urgent need to critically interrogate new discourses linking population size with climate change and promoting agricultural and reproductive technologies as a means to address associated problems. This article analyses the specific discourses produced by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) in relation to these ‘population technologies’ and ‘climate-smart’ agriculture in particular. Drawing on concepts and approaches developed by Black, postcolonial and Marxist feminists including intersectionality, racial capitalism, social reproduction, and reproductive and environmental justice, we explore how within these discourses, the ‘geo-populationism’ of the BMGF’s climate-smart agriculture initiatives, like the ‘demo-populationism’ of its family planning interventions, mobilises neoliberal notions of empowerment, productivity and innovation. Not only do these populationist discourses reinforce neoliberal framings and policies which extend existing regimes of racialised and gendered socio-spatial inequality, but they also underwrite global capital accumulation through new science and technologies. The BMGF’s representations of its climate-smart agriculture initiatives offer the opportunity to understand how threats of climate change are mobilised to reanimate and repackage the Malthusian disequilibrium between human fertility and agricultural productivity. Drawing upon our readings of these discourses, we critically propose the concept of ‘necro-populationism’ to refer to processes that target racialised and gendered populations for dispossession, toxification, slow death and embodied violence, even while direct accountability for the effects of these changes is dispersed. We also identify a need for further research which will not only trace the ways in which the BMGF’s global policies are materialised, spatialised, reproduced and reoriented by multiple actors in local contexts, but will also recognise and affirm the diverse forms through which these ‘necro-populationist’ processes are disavowed and resisted.},

	abstract = {The world food crisis in 2008 highlighted the susceptibility of the global food system to price shocks. Here we use annual staple food production and trade data from 1992–2009 to analyse the changing properties of the global food system. Over the 18 year study period, we show that the global food system is relatively homogeneous (85\% of countries have low or marginal food self-sufficiency) and increases in complexity, with the number of global wheat and rice trade connections doubling and trade flows increasing by 42 and 90\%, respectively. The increased connectivity and flows within these global trade networks suggest that the global food system is vulnerable to systemic disruptions, especially considering the tendency for exporting countries to switch to non-exporting states during times of food scarcity in the global markets. To test this hypothesis, we superimpose continental-scale disruptions on the wheat and rice trade networks. We find greater absolute reductions in global wheat and rice exports along with larger losses in network connectivity as the networks evolve due to disruptions in European wheat and Asian rice production. Importantly, our findings indicate that least developed countries suffer greater import losses in more connected networks through their increased dependence on imports for staple foods (due to these large-scale disturbances): mean (median) wheat losses as percentages of staple food supply are 8.9\% (3.8\%) for 1992–1996, increasing to 11\% (5.7\%) for 2005–2009. Over the same intervals, rice losses increase from 8.2\% (2.2\%) to 14\% (5.2\%). Our work indicates that policy efforts should focus on balancing the efficiency of international trade (and its associated specialization) with increased resilience of domestic production and global demand diversity.},

Throughout the world, major shifts in dietary patterns are occurring, even in the consumption of basic staples towards more diversified diets. Accompanying these changes in food consumption at a global and regional level have been considerable health consequences. Populations in those countries undergoing rapid transition are experiencing nutritional transition. The diverse nature of this transition may be the result of differences in socio-demographic factors and other consumer characteristics. Among other factors including urbanization and food industry marketing, the policies of trade liberalization over the past two decades have implications for health by virtue of being a factor in facilitating the ‘nutrition transition’ that is associated with rising rates of obesity and chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. Future food policies must consider both agricultural and health sectors, thereby enabling the development of coherent and sustainable policies that will ultimately benefit agriculture, human health and the environment.},

	abstract = {Women ofthird world countries, or in the developing countries, play a major role in managing natural resources. Women have always had a close relationship with the trees and the forests and traditionally they have gathered products, which have provided them with the basic three ‘Fs’ offuel, food and fodder and for a variety ofother uses. While men consider the forest more in terms of commercial possibilities, women see it as a source of basic domestic need. They have a profound knowledge of the plants, animals and ecological processes around them. Their role in agriculture and animal husbandry as well as in the household activities makes them the daily managers of the living environment. Third world peasants, who were mainly women, for over centuries have innovated in agriculture and the methods they used have been lasting and sustainable, this knowledge which was acquired for over centuries began to be eroded and erased with western model of green revolution. Globally, the major threat to the environment, in terms of promoting agricultural exports, has been through the replacement of traditional food crops by hybrid cash crops. Degradation of land, pollution through pesticides and fertilizers and loss of biodiversity has been some ofthe more disturbing environmental impacts. Because of the unchecked pollution women are the worst affected, they have also caused health problems among children and men. The present paper examines the impact of such changes on women with the help of a few research studies.},

To counter these years of neglect, the then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for “a uniquely African Green Revolution”. Since then, a number of initiatives have emerged or are emerging to realize this important vision. As more money and attention galvanizes much-needed action on the African Green Revolution, a vigorous debate is required to ensure that the mission of improving food security on the world’s poorest continent is achieved in the most effective, comprehensive and inclusive manner possible. The African Green Revolution cannot be limited to increasing yields of staple crops but must be designed as a driver of sustainable development, which includes gender empowerment and nutrition elements. This paper first reviews the Asian Green Revolution’s successes and shortcomings from a nutrition and gender perspective and then outlines what the global community can do to ensure that some of the limitations of the Asian Green Revolution, specifically with regard to nutrition and gender, are not repeated.},

The book grew out of collaborative work done for Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) flagship report, The State of Food and Agriculture 2010–11, Women in agriculture: Closing the gender gap for development, highlighting the important and varied roles of women in agriculture, their unequal access to productive resources and opportunities relative to men, and the gains that could be achieved by closing the gender gap in agriculture. This book provides a more thorough treatment of the conceptual and empirical basis of the FAO report, and fills a niche in the literature for a standard reference for the analysis of gender issues in agriculture. This chapter defines basic concepts related to sex and gender and discusses changes in the way gender issues have been conceptualized in agriculture from the work of Ester Boserup, to the Women in Development (WID) and Gender and Development (GAD) debate, to current approaches that recognize the importance of both women and men and the interplay between the two in agriculture. It traces how gender issues have been addressed institutionally and discusses shifting paradigms in the economic analysis of the household, including how demographic processes surrounding household formation and dissolution, gender differences across the life cycle, and migration have implications for the gender gap in agriculture. It then provides a summary of each of the chapters, suggests areas for future research, and explores implications for development policy and practice.},

However, this diversity is threatened by climate change, habitat degradation, increasing human population, among other factors. Given the large number of CWR, the creation of a CWR inventory is the starting point for the development of a national CWR conservation strategy. The process for the preparation of a national CWR inventory for Mexico consisted of (i) producing a list of national crop species, (ii) matching the crop genera with the list of national flora to produce a CWR checklist, and (iii) prioritizing the CWR checklist according to a series of selection criteria and using a ranking system. The selection criteria included the economic value of the related crop, the potential for crop improvement, food intake, threat status, geographical distribution, and crop use. Applying these criteria, 310 prioritized CWR taxa were selected ( 2\% of the national CWR diversity), integrating the national CWR inventory. They are mostly related to food crops of national but also global importance, such as maize (Zea mays L.), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), squash (Cucurbita spp.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), and sweet potato [Ipomoea batatas (L.)

Two processes contribute to this loss; first is the replacement of landraces by modern varieties, and second is the abandonment of traditional crops in favor of cash crops. We studied the expression of these processes in a region that is both an agro-biodiversity and cultural center and one of the most significant fruit exporters of Mexico. We analyzed agricultural change based on the transformation of cropping areas and the primary crops’ locations in Michoacán state. We examined the crop-harvested area statistics from 1950 to 2015, and identified 23 crops as the most important in terms of harvested area and monetary value. After NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement), harvested area for nine crops changed significantly: seven crops increased, and two decreased. Positive trends were observed for commercial fruits oriented to export markets, and negative trends were observed for traditional crops. These crops, such as beans and maize, are important for food security. Additionally, we analyzed how these land-use and agricultural changes overlap in zones of maize planted-area change. Using a maize-race collection database, we identified three native maize races that could be at risk due to the abandonment of maize in favor of commercial crops.},

The special section on Food Security (12 February, p. [797][2]) did not consider the value of crop species diversity. It is agronomically, ecologically, nutritionally, and economically risky and unsustainable to rely almost exclusively on a handful of major crops to provide food for the world's projected 9 billion people by 2050. Indeed, this approach may have been partially responsible for the failure of the green revolution in much of Africa.

Calls for improvement of major crops (described in M. Tester and P. Langridge's Review, “Breeding technologies to increase crop production in a changing world,” p. [818][3]), such as Africa's major staples (described in G. Ejeta's Perspective, “African green revolution needn't be a mirage,” p. [831][4]), should be extended to include locally important crops. Such crops generally are well adapted to local conditions, form the basis of local food systems, show remarkable resilience to environmental change, and frequently possess unique characteristics that are in demand on the global marketplace ([ 1 ][5]). Although the breeding infrastructure for such species is often severely underdeveloped and underfunded, breeding can be facilitated by linkages to closely related major crops ([ 2 ][6]). Strategies that aim to increase or sustain crop diversity in agricultural production systems have many benefits, including the maintenance of cultural practices and traditional knowledge, balanced nutrition, increased resilience to climate extremes, and exploitation of a broader array of environments for food production.

En esta edición se han puesto al día aquellos aspectos centrales para los cuales se cuenta con nuevos datos e información, o se muestra nueva información cuando ha cambiado la forma de medir y no es comparable. Capital natural de México ha sido un referente importante para identificar prioridades de atención en diversas áreas de investigación así como en la gestión para la conservación y manejo sustentable de la diversidad biológica de nuestro país, y ha sido la base para la formulación de la Estrategia Nacional sobre Biodiversidad de México y Plan de Acción 2016-2030.
Por ello, mantener actualizada la información de esta obra, con base en el mejor conocimiento científico disponible permitirá comparar las tendencias de cambio, lo cual es muy relevante para diversos usuarios, tanto de diferentes órdenes de gobierno como de la sociedad civil en general, sobre todo si queremos continuar transitando hacia la sustentabilidad para el bienestar social de los mexicanos, con mejores prácticas de manejo alineadas a la conservación de nuestro patrimonio natural. La información de esta obra se irá actualizando paulatinamente, dada la importancia de contar con el mejor conocimiento científico disponible para la toma de decisiones. A pesar de los avances tecnológicos de los últimos años, la tarea de documentar distintos aspectos en torno a la diversidad biológica del país es enorme, dado que la obra considera todos los aspectos de la biodiversidad, desde la variabilidad genética de los organismos hasta la diversidad de los ecosistemas, sus procesos ecológicos y servicios ambientales, también considera el efecto que actividades humanas, políticas públicas y reglamentaciones han tenido sobre el patrimonio natural de México. Sin embargo,
se cuenta con el marco conceptual de evaluación de los ecosistemas y con nuevos contenidos y componentes del Sistema Nacional de Información sobre Biodiversidad, así como con información de otras fuentes. Cabe destacar el papel de la red de especialistas que ha colaborado no sólo en esta obra y con la Conabio, sino que desde su ámbito han generado nuevo conocimiento, y documentando diversos aspectos relacionados con la biodiversidad y su gestión. A finales de 2016 se publicó el cuarto volumen, que analiza las capacidades humanas e institucionales, lo que fortalece a la obra como una herramienta para ayudar a valorar el capital naltural y entender los retos para lograr el desarrollo sustentable de México.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Places with high species diversity have high linguistic diversity, whereas areas with low species diversity tend to have low linguistic diversity. Objective: To characterize the intriguing relationship between biological and cultural diversity, a correlation that has been discussed at a global scale, but here tested for the first time in Mexico. Methods: We compiled exhaustive databases on both endangered species and endangered languages, and reviewed available literature on Mexico's biocultural diversity with a focus on endangered and critically endangered species and languages. Results: With 364 living languages, Mexico is the world's fifth most linguistically diverse country, but 64 of these languages are facing a very high risk of disappearance and 13 have already disappeared. Mexico is also the fourth most biologically diverse country, but 1 213 species of its flora and fauna are threatened with extinction and at least 127 species were recently extinct. Conclusions: Indigenous peoples are custodians of much of the world's biocultural diversity. As the world grows less linguistically and culturally diverse, it is also becoming less biologically diverse. Mexico's biological and linguistic diversity show strong geographic overlap, with the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and Michoacán harboring most species and most languages. Similarly, Mexico's biodiversity hotspots mirror language hotspots, and areas with the highest number of endangered species overlap with areas where the endangerment of languages is also the highest.},

	abstract = {Mexico has a regulatory framework since 2008 to boost the production of bioenergy, but this has not been yet significantly increased; However, there are regions and states concerned to take the lead, as Veracruz, where the state government promotes the planting of crops for the production of biofuels, as well as, the industrial restructuring of the utilization of the sugar cane. The region of CordobaPaso del Macho represents an area of high interest because 9 of the 22 state mills are located there and 3 bioethanol producing companies are established. The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact that will have the transformation of the national and state policies on biofuels, primarily with energy cane, its socio-economic scope and posible socio-environmental externalities when becoming producing regions. A documentary, bibliographic and hemerographic analysis of publications on the subject from 2009 to 2013 was conducted. We visited this region in the months of July to August 2011, conducting participatory workshops in 3 communities, as well as, 20 semistructured interviews with various actors involved in the sugar cane production. The results revealed that Veracruz lacks a comprehensive energy project in spite of its significant oil reserves. In addition, the results show that such state heavily relies on attracting foreign investment, hindering the transition towards an energy policy based on renewable resources and local environmental, technological and social capacities. Agrofuels represent a regional alternative, in small and medium-scale for the production of biofuels. Nevertheless, regulatory mechanisms must be established to ensure the diversified use of the soil, to preserve the food supply and to prevent it from becoming more expensive. Furthermore, it is required to consider the social profitability and to establish strict control mechanisms to preserve the protected natural areas.},

	abstract = {Introduction. In healthcare, change is usually detected by statistical techniques comparing outcomes before and after an intervention. A common problem faced by researchers is distinguishing change due to secular trends from change due to an intervention. Interrupted time-series analysis has been shown to be effective in describing trends in retrospective time-series and in detecting change, but methods are often biased towards the point of the intervention. Binary outcomes are typically modelled by logistic regression where the log-odds of the binary event is expressed as a function of covariates such as time, making model parameters difficult to interpret. The aim of this study was to present a technique that directly models the probability of binary events to describe change patterns using linear sections. Methods. We describe a modelling method that fits progressively more complex linear sections to the time-series of binary variables. Model fitting uses maximum likelihood optimisation and models are compared for goodness of fit using Akaike’s Information Criterion. The best model describes the most likely change scenario. We applied this modelling technique to evaluate hip fracture patient mortality rate for a total of 2777 patients over a 6-year period, before and after the introduction of a dedicated hip fracture unit (HFU) at a Level 1, Major Trauma Centre. Results. The proposed modelling technique revealed time-dependent trends that explained how the implementation of the HFU influenced mortality rate in patients sustaining proximal femoral fragility fractures. The technique allowed modelling of the entire time-series without bias to the point of intervention. Modelling the binary variable of interest directly, as opposed to a transformed variable, improved the interpretability of the results. Conclusion. The proposed segmented linear regression modelling technique using maximum likelihood estimation can be employed to effectively detect trends in time-series of binary variables in retrospective studies.},

	abstract = {We describe a procedure for evaluating the relative importance of beta diversity, nestedness, and similarity properties of ecological data matrices containing density, cover or biomass scores of species. Our goals are achieved by extension of the simplex approach – originally proposed for presence–absence data – to abundances. Basically, the method involves decomposition of the Marczewski–Steinhaus coefficient of dissimilarity between pairs of sites into two fractions, one derived from differences between total abundance and the other from differences due to abundance replacement. These are contrasted by the similarity function counterpart, known as the Ruzicka coefficient, and are displayed graphically using ternary (or 2D simplex) plots. Interpretation is aided by calculating percentage contributions from these components to the (dis)similarity structure. Measures of replacement and nestedness are new for abundance data; these are considered complementary phenomena reflecting antithetic ecological processes that are analogous to those operating at the presence–absence level. The method is illustrated by artificial data and a range of actual ecological data sets representing different groups of organisms, different scales and different types of data. While the simplex diagrams and associated coefficients are meaningful by themselves, their comparison with presence–absence based results gives additional insight into data structure and background factors.},

To assess whether the target was met, it became necessary to quantify temporal trends in measures of diversity. This resulted in a marked shift in focus for biodiversity measurement. We explore the developments in measuring biodiversity that was prompted by the 2010 target. We consider measures based on species proportions, and also explain why a geometric mean of relative abundance estimates was preferred to such measures for assessing progress towards the target. We look at the use of diversity proﬁles, and consider how species similarity can be incorporated into diversity measures. We also discuss measures of turnover that can be used to quantify shifts in community composition arising, for example, from climate change.},

	abstract = {Over the past decades, the choices of farmers and societies regarding what to grow and eat are being reshaped drastically, as suggested by the diversification of crop supply within countries and its simultaneous homogenization across them. Such a trend could be supported by parallel shifts in production (i.e. diversification within countries, homogenization across countries) or by the growing redistribution introduced by international trade which can even mask reductions in production diversity (i.e. specialization) within countries. Here we assessed the spatial and temporal trends in crop production, exports, imports, and supply diversity based on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) for 152 countries and 49 crops from 1961 to 2013. Within countries, the diversity of crop supply increased at a faster rate than the diversity of production, which grew only slightly. Both were surpassed by the diversification of trade, which, within countries, involved a much faster diversity growth of imports compared to exports. Across countries, crop production homogenized at slower rates than crop supply, indicating that crop trade was important for explaining this decoupling. Mirroring country-based analyses, a crop-perspective indicates that crops are becoming more geographically ubiquitous for all the components of the food balance. However, this pattern had important exceptions, like oil palm which has increased its production concentrating in a few specialized countries. We evaluate our results in the context of the multiple social-ecological trade-offs related to international trade and the resilience of the global food system.},

            Nutritional stability – a food system’s capacity to provide sufficient nutrients despite disturbance – is an important, yet challenging to measure outcome of diversified agriculture. Using 55 years of data across 184 countries, we assemble 22,000 bipartite crop-nutrient networks to quantify nutritional stability by simulating crop and nutrient loss in a country, and assess its relationship to crop diversity across regions, over time and between imports versus in country production. We find a positive, saturating relationship between crop diversity and nutritional stability across countries, but also show that over time nutritional stability remained stagnant or decreased in all regions except Asia. These results are attributable to diminishing returns on crop diversity, with recent gains in crop diversity among crops with fewer nutrients, or with nutrients already in a country’s food system. Finally, imports are positively associated with crop diversity and nutritional stability, indicating that many countries’ nutritional stability is market exposed.},

Field crop diversity in the Midwest has been very low throughout the past 142 years. Describing spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural biodiversity may be an important step toward better understanding its effect on agroecosystem services. We describe species-level field crop diversity at the national and state level for the United States, using annual survey data for a 142-yr period. National-level field crop diversity was very low around 1870 and peaked around 1960, after which time it began to decline. Many states had their highest levels of diversity between 1940 and 1960, but trends varied strongly among states. In 1900, the states with highest diversity were in the Northeast, but in 2012 the highest diversity was found in California, North Dakota, and the southeastern states. Diversity in the central US Corn Belt was very low throughout the 142-yr period studied. These results show that changes in diversity do not necessarily follow a simple continuous decline when moving from “traditional” to “industrial” agriculture.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem services are critical to human survival; in selected cases, maintaining these services provides a powerful argument for conserving biodiversity. Yet, the ecological and economic underpinnings of most services are poorly understood, impeding their conservation and management. For centuries, farmers have imported colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera) to fields and orchards for pollination services. These colonies are becoming increasingly scarce, however, because of diseases, pesticides, and other impacts. Native bee communities also provide pollination services, but the amount they provide and how this varies with land management practices are unknown. Here, we document the individual species and aggregate community contributions of native bees to crop pollination, on farms that varied both in their proximity to natural habitat and management type (organic versus conventional). On organic farms near natural habitat, we found that native bee communities could provide full pollination services even for a crop with heavy pollination requirements (e.g., watermelon, Citrullus lanatus), without the intervention of managed honey bees. All other farms, however, experienced greatly reduced diversity and abundance of native bees, resulting in insufficient pollination services from native bees alone. We found that diversity was essential for sustaining the service, because of year-to-year variation in community composition. Continued degradation of the agro-natural landscape will destroy this “free” service, but conservation and restoration of bee habitat are potentially viable economic alternatives for reducing dependence on managed honey bees.},

This paper contributes to fill this research gap by drawing on a multi-site case study in the Yucatán region in Mexico. By applying regression analysis, the significance of the association between home garden diversity and food security is confirmed. Plant diversity is found to have a positive association with food consumption scores and the frequency of vegetable intakes. The number of animals used for food purposes is also found to have positive and significant associations with food consumption scores and frequency of meat intakes. However, the dimension and the significance of these positive associations were found to vary among communities and quantiles of the distribution of food security measures. In the households studied, younger individuals and better-educated people, males and Spanish speakers were more likely to engage in jobs in urban areas. Engagement in urban jobs was found to involve complementarities with the overall plant diversity of home gardens, but also trade-offs with the diversity of vegetables and other herbs used for food purposes and with the abundance of animals raised for food purposes.},

	abstract = {The global increase in the proportion of land cultivated with pollinator-dependent crops implies increased reliance on pollination services. Yet agricultural practices themselves can profoundly affect pollinator supply and pollination. Extensive monocultures are associated with a limited pollinator supply and reduced pollination, whereas agricultural diversification can enhance both. Therefore, areas where agricultural diversity has increased, or at least been maintained, may better sustain high and more stable productivity of pollinator-dependent crops. Given that {\textgreater}80\% of all crops depend, to varying extents, on insect pollination, a global increase in agricultural pollinator dependence over recent decades might have led to a concomitant increase in agricultural diversification. We evaluated whether an increase in the area of pollinator-dependent crops has indeed been associated with an increase in agricultural diversity, measured here as crop diversity, at the global, regional, and country scales for the period 1961–2016. Globally, results show a relatively weak and decelerating rise in agricultural diversity over time that was largely decoupled from the strong and continually increasing trend in agricultural dependency on pollinators. At regional and country levels, there was no consistent relationship between temporal changes in pollinator dependence and crop diversification. Instead, our results show heterogeneous responses in which increasing pollinator dependence for some countries and regions has been associated with either an increase or a decrease in agricultural diversity. Particularly worrisome is a rapid expansion of pollinator-dependent oilseed crops in several countries of the Americas and Asia that has resulted in a decrease in agricultural diversity. In these regions, reliance on pollinators is increasing, yet agricultural practices that undermine pollination services are expanding. Our analysis has thereby identified world regions of particular concern where environmentally damaging practices associated with large-scale, industrial agriculture threaten key ecosystem services that underlie productivity, in addition to other benefits provided by biodiversity.},

Since pre-Hispanic times, the Mexicans have developed a traditional diet based on corn and beans which provided the essential amino acids necessary for protein synthesis, as well as a resistant starch protective against cancer. Soluble ﬁber obtained from cactus plants provided a healthy glucose and lipid homeostasis. Edible green leaves quelites co-evolved with the 677T allele of the MTHFR gene with a reduced enzyme activity and pumpkin seeds, chia and amaranth provided essential omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids that modulate the inﬂammatory response. While the presence of AVI haplogroup of the TAS38 type 2 receptor gene favored the consumption of chili and bitter greens, the C-13910 allele of the LCT gene discouraged milk consumption. After the Spanish conquest, the genetic and cultural admixture both shifted the balance between our genes and our ancestral environment, which may now place humans at risk for the development of chronic diseases. Therefore, the Mexican population even though culturally modern should strive to conserve the consumption of traditional ethnic foods that originally shaped their genetic history.},

To accomplish this, it is essential to transcend the reductionist vision prevailing in conventional agricultural sciences. In agroecology, it is needed to have practical tools to evaluate agricultural situations systemically. Unfortunately, there are few concrete tools to perform this task. In this work, it is proposed a new index to measure agrobiodiversity. This index allows the evaluation of the system as a whole. In this index, besides of measuring the richness and abundance of the elements of the system, it is also taken into account their interaction. This allows the evaluation of functional attributes of the agrobiodiversity. Here is shown through simple examples some of the advantages of this new index.},

	abstract = {Farm production diversity has the potential to inﬂuence the diversity of household diets, an important nutrition outcome associated with the nutrient adequacy of diets and the nutritional status of individuals. Yet, little empirical research has assessed the relationship between farm diversity and diet diversity or the plausible causal mechanisms that may operate between these two constructs. This research examines cross-sectional data from the Malawi Third Integrated Household Survey (IHS3), a nationally representative sample of farming households in Malawi, implemented from March 2010–March 2011 as part of the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study – Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA). These data were used to determine the relationship between farm production diversity and household dietary diversity, and to identify determinants of this relationship. Two indicators of dietary diversity, a modiﬁed Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS), and the Food Consumption Score (FCS), were calculated along with three indicators of farm production diversity including the Simpson’s Index, a metric accounting for both species richness and evenness. In multiple regression analyses, adjusting standard errors for the complex survey design of the IHS3 and controlling for the effects of several covariates on household dietary diversity, farm production diversity was consistently positively associated with dietary diversity (P {\textless} 0.0001). The association of increased farm diversity as measured by a combined crop and livestock measure on dietary diversity was signiﬁcantly greater in woman-headed households compared to those headed by men (HDDS: P = 0.008; FCS: P = 0.076). The positive association of farm diversity with dietary diversity was also greater in wealthier households (P {\textless} 0.05). Consumption of legumes, vegetables and fruits was especially strongly associated with greater farm diversity. More diverse production systems may contribute to more diverse household diets. However, this relationship is complex; it may be inﬂuenced by gender, wealth, control of household decisions, the relative market-orientation of a household’s agricultural production, and the speciﬁc nature of farm diversity.},

	abstract = {Recognition that climate change could have negative consequences for agricultural production has generated a desire to build resilience into agricultural systems. One rational and cost-effective method may be the implementation of increased agricultural crop diversification. Crop diversification can improve resilience in a variety of ways: by engendering a greater ability to suppress pest outbreaks and dampen pathogen transmission, which may worsen under future climate scenarios, as well as by buffering crop production from the effects of greater climate variability and extreme events. Such benefits point toward the obvious value of adopting crop diversification to improve resilience, yet adoption has been slow. Economic incentives encouraging production of a select few crops, the push for biotechnology strategies, and the belief that monocultures are more productive than diversified systems have been hindrances in promoting this strategy. However, crop diversification can be implemented in a variety of forms and at a variety of scales, allowing farmers to choose a strategy that both increases resilience and provides economic benefits.},

Built by activists and NGOs, these systems were adopted by agribusiness. Such firms try to capture consumers and react to opinion campaigns, whilst appropriating the conservation (or ‘fair’) discourse. This leads to the rise of new forms of third-party certifications of food production based on private standards and, hence, to new forms of contract relations between producers and buyers. The nature of these relationships is not always evident in these new labels or in the discourse built to justify them. This is particularly so in the case of goods produced in the South to be traded and sold in the North, as the case of Starbucks illustrates. By the end of the 1990s, Starbucks, operating through an NGO called Conservation International (CI), arrived at the region of El Triunfo, in Chiapas, and contacted the producers’ cooperatives that were trying to find a market for their product. CI promoted Starbucks standards to raise the coffee quality and won the control over the production system. Meanwhile, the producers forced to sell their coffee through the largest trade company (AMSA) against whom the cooperatives were created, lost the control over their own organization. When some cooperatives refused the deal, they suffered divisions but could survive thanks the Fair Trade (FT) network in Chiapas.},

					Empleando el estudio de caso del cultivo de la palma africana para la producción de aceite en Chiapas, México, este artículo analiza el tema de patrones de desarrollo alternativos a la globalización neoliberal. En particular, discute el problema del retorno de la intervención del Esta- do (neofordismo) como un instrumento para promover el desarrollo socioeconómico. Chiapas ha sido el escenario del movimiento zapatista de 1994. Como resultado de este levantamiento, y a pesar de su abierta postura neoliberal, el Estado mexicano intervino de manera signi cativa en Chiapas. En este contexto, se ha buscado el monocultivo de la palma africana como una estrategia para atender la pobreza local entre agri- cultores, generar formas alternativas y renovables de energía y proveer un esquema para el crecimiento socioeconómico en el área. Este artículo ilustra los resultados contradictorios de este proyecto “intervencionista” de desarrollo y las consecuencias y resistencias que conllevó. El análisis de este caso revela la naturaleza problemática de esquemas intervencio- nistas dirigidos por el Estado-nación en un contexto marcado por la cri- sis emergente del modelo neoliberal. Subraya también la relevancia de las iniciativas locales generadas por las aspiraciones y habilidades de los residentes locales.},

Field crop diversity in the Midwest has been very low throughout the past 142 years. Describing spatiotemporal patterns of agricultural biodiversity may be an important step toward better understanding its effect on agroecosystem services. We describe species-level field crop diversity at the national and state level for the United States, using annual survey data for a 142-yr period. National-level field crop diversity was very low around 1870 and peaked around 1960, after which time it began to decline. Many states had their highest levels of diversity between 1940 and 1960, but trends varied strongly among states. In 1900, the states with highest diversity were in the Northeast, but in 2012 the highest diversity was found in California, North Dakota, and the southeastern states. Diversity in the central US Corn Belt was very low throughout the 142-yr period studied. These results show that changes in diversity do not necessarily follow a simple continuous decline when moving from “traditional” to “industrial” agriculture.},

Original, multimethod research with South Asian immigrant and Mexican migrant farmworkers examines employment practices, working conditions, and health-care access. We ﬁnd that both groups engage in precarious work, with consequences for their health and safety, including immigrant workers with citizenship. Nevertheless, migrant guest workers are subject to more coercive forms of labor discipline and a narrower range of social protection than immigrants. We argue that while formal citizenship can mitigate some dimensions of precariousness for farmworkers racialized as non-white, achieving a more just, safer food system will require broader policies to improve employer compliance and address legislative shortcomings that only weakly protect agricultural labor.},

However, the water-energy-food security nexus concept has mostly been analyzed at higher scales in a top-down manner, while examples of bottom-up and local scale applications remain limited. Breaching this gap, the research presented in this paper describes and assesses the water-energy-food nexus from a smallholder farm household perspective in the context of rural Ethiopia through a genderspecific lens. We adopted the “Actors, Resources, Dynamics and Interactions” participatory approach to co-develop a mental model of this nexus concept. Using this approach, we were able to examine the key elements and interlinkages among major nexus related resources that affect management according to gender. The results indicate that there are four aspects that differentiate between male and female farm household management with respect to the water-energy-food nexus. These differences include gender specific productive roles, perceptions of target resources, access to external actors, and decision making with respect to target resource management and utilization, which may affect the dynamics and governance of important components of the water-energy-food nexus.},

The value of cotton depends on the fibre (lint) enriched by cellulose. The developmental programme of cotton fibre is highly susceptible to environmental factors in long span from single cells initiation, elongation to maturity, certainly mainly regulated by endogenous genes perhaps involved thousands of genes. Recently, the genome of G. raimondii with D genome as putative contributor to fibre-producing cotton species including G. hirsutum and G. barbadense was sequenced and assembled, which provides reference to assemble EST sequences and analyse the phylogeny, chromosomal location, gene structure, conserved domains and expression profiling. The sequence of D genome could be assisted as reference to scan and identify genes from allotetraploid cotton Biotechnology is the present and the future of cotton breeding. Applications of biotechnology have made great progress in the creation of novel germplasm, improved fibres and the creation of herbicide-resistant cotton and disease tolerant cotton, especially insect-resistant cotton such as Bt cotton. So we believe that the breakthroughs in cotton genomics and applications of biotechnology will bring new vitality to cotton breeding.},
